The Supervisory Board was informed of important matters about the financial result \nof the Bank, the business development, the capital and liquidity situation as well as the risk \nmanagement profile. This has been done during the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its \nCommittees as well as by means of written and oral ad-hoc reporting. \nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board welcomed a number of new members, whilst maintaining effective \noversight of the Bank’s risk profile and financial results. Geopolitical events in Europe and around \nthe world which impact business activity and risk remained in focus of the Supervisory Board. \nIncreasing levels of interest rates have returned rates to more normal historic levels in Europe, \naiding profitability, but also resulting in the repricing of risky assets, which has contributed to the \ninstability of a number of banks. The Supervisory Board continues to monitor these developments \nas well as regulatory matters to ensure a strong and effective governance framework.\nPERSONNEL CHANGES IN THE MANAGEMENT BOARD\nJessica Kaffrén joined J.P. Morgan SE on January 2, 2024 as the new Head of Outsourcing, Oper-\nations and Technology, which was previously covered on an interim basis by Nicholas Conron \n(Outsourcing) and Burkhard Kübel-Sorger (Operations and Technology), following the departure \nof Cindyrella Amistadi on March 15, 2023.

Morgan SE \nParis was completed in October 2023, impacting Private \nBank, Payments and Commercial Banking, in our efforts to \nfurther simplify the Firm’s legal entity structure and sustain-\nably complement JPMSE’s existing product offering.\n– \u0007And finally, we successfully injected € 2.5 billion in additional \nTier 2 capital in the light of heightened market volatility in \nQ1 2023 resulting in higher Risk-Weighted Assets (“RWA”) \nand capital usage, tightening the Minimum Requirements \nfor Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities – Risk-Weighted \nAssets (“MREL-RWA”) headroom against regulatory require-\nments, in order to support further growth.\nWe closed 2023 with total revenues of € 5,600 million based \non IFRS and Profit before Tax (“PBT”) of € 2,567 million, \ndemonstrating a solid expense management in spite of mate-\nrial contribution to the Single Resolution Fund and significant \nprovisions for salary tax and VAT in France for the financial \nyears 2021 to 2023. Material net releases of Loan Loss Pro-\nvisions (“LLP”) in the amount of € 56 million were, on the \ncontrary, a positive contributing factor to PBT. JPMSE’s prof-\nitability metrics outperformed the targets set with a return \non equity (“RoE”) of 6.8%, return on risk-weighted assets \n(“RoRWA”) of 1.4% and an efficiency ratio of 55.3%.\n1.2. OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS AND RISK STRATEGY\nJ.P. Morgan SE combines the main business areas of Cor-\nporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) (which includes Banking, \nMarkets and Securites Services), Private Bank (“PB”) and \n1. Introduction\n1.1. LOOKING BACK ON 2023\n2023 was the second year after the creation of J.P. Morgan SE \n(“JPMSE”, the “Bank”, the “entity”, “we” or ”our”) as result \nof the cross-border merger of J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg \nS.A. (“JPMBL”) and J.P. Morgan Bank (Ireland) plc (“JPMBI”) \nas transferring entities into J.P. Morgan AG (“JPMAG”) in \nJanuary 2022. \nJ.P. Morgan SE continues to be headquartered in Frankfurt and \noperates in 15 countries in the European Economic Area \n(EEA) and the UK. As an integral part of JPMorgan Chase & \nCo. (“JPMorgan Chase”, the “Firm”, or “JPM Group”), we con-\ntinued to contribute approximately 30% to the overall EMEA \nrevenues. This was mainly due to a customer-centric, global \nbusiness model of JPM Group, as well as a strong Management \nBoard that ensures leadership, governance, risk management \nand compliance with regulatory requirements.\nThe combined unit is among the five largest banking legal \nentities in Germany, and among the top 22 under direct \nsupervision of the ECB in the EU, based on size of the balance \nsheet. Per year-end 2023, its total capital base was € 40 billion \n(rounded), with capital ratios of 20.0% CET1 and 34.4% Total \nCapital Ratio.\nThroughout the year, we continued our efforts to expand our \nproduct offering to our clients, to further strive for simplifica-\ntion, leverage our branch network, and strengthen our capital \nbase. Highlights in 2023 also include \n– \u0007Completed first successful participation in the EBA Stress \nTest with an ultimately strong CET 1 capital ratio of 13.9%.\nManagement Report for the Financial Year  \nfrom January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023",

Although the impact of inflation eased towards the \nend, it remained above the central banks’ targets at the end of \nthe year, with central banks maintaining peak interest rates. \nAs we move into 2024, fears of a slide into recession are con-\ntinuing. For an economy such as Germany’s, with a relatively \nmodest growth potential of around 1%, the list of headwinds \ncould wipe out any growth. At the same time, the shocks since \n2019 continue to have economic repercussions, with some of \nthem being positive.\n3.2.

Banking experienced a shortfall \ndue to lower revenues in Investment & Corporate Banking while \nrevenues in Securities Services and Private Bank were slightly \nbelow Plan.\nTotal Expenses were materially in-line with the Plan 2023. \nExpected Credit Losses were significantly lower than Plan \nwhich was mainly driven by releases of loan loss provisions \nin the Private Bank and Lending following build-ups in 2022 \nas a result of the war in Ukraine.\nTherefore, the positive business development in 2023 is ulti-\nmately reflected in a strong pre-tax profit of € 2,567 million, \nbeing 33% or € 640 million above Plan, demonstrating a \nsolid expense management in spite of unplanned provisions \nfor salary tax and VAT in France.\n3.1.

This higher interest rate environment is \nthe main factor and drove the increase in net interest income, \nnotably in the Corporate segment. \nThe net income from financial assets and liabilities measured \nat fair value in the amount of € 1,509 million was lower in 2023 \ncompared to € 1,665 million in the prior year.

Deriva-\ntives and cash collateral have different treatment between the \ntwo GAAPs, and this delta at the amount of € 138.6 billion has \nbeen presented in the table above.

Additionally, as \npreviously stated, these loans are subject to ECL recognition, \nwhich is not the case for IFRS. Day 1 P&L is another valuation \ndifference which is being performed under IFRS, however not \napplied under HGB. Day 1 P&L represents the gains or losses \nthat are recognized (at the time of initial recognition) as the \ndifference between a transaction price (in relation to an asset \nor a liability) and the item’s fair value (please refer to note 30. \nfor further details on fair value measurement and hierarchy). \nIn HGB, fair value measurement is applied in accordance with \n§ 255 Para. 4 HGB (please also see HGB note 2.2.). The net \namount resulting from this different approach between the \ntwo GAAPs totalled € 20 million, respectively: mark-down of \nloans (held to collect and sell) is € 7 million and Day 1 P&L is \n€ 27 million. \nNet trading profit is impacted by another delta which is \nrelated to ESG loans treatment under IFRS at the amount of \n€ 5 million. Given that the ESG loans held at amortized cost \nhave failed the assessment under which contractual cash \nflows are solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI“ \ntest), they were considered to be accounted for as fair value \nthrough profit and loss. As these loans have an interest rate \nwhich is linked to ESG-features related to the borrower, these \nfeatures do not represent an embedded derivative which \nwould need to be separated under HGB. Thus, under HGB \nthese loans are measured in their entirety at amortized cost \ntherefore leading to a delta between the two GAAPs.\nTaxes are treated differently under IFRS and HGB leading to \na delta presented in the walk from one GAAP to the other. \nUnder HGB, deferred taxes are reversed given the option-\nality (per § 274, Para. 1 sentence 2, HGB) that exists to do",

The general IT \nsystem, including that for accounting, is secured against \nunauthorized access.\n4.5.3. Key Regulations and Control Activities\nThe rules and measures of the ICS aim to ensure that business \ntransactions are recorded in compliance with legal and inter-\nnal requirements in a timely and complete manner, and that \nassets and liabilities within the annual financial statements are \nproperly estimated, valued and reported. The booking docu-\nmentation provides a reliable information base and a clear \npaper trail.\nIn the JPM Group, the regulations of the Financial Accounting \nStandard Board are applied as uniform valuation and account-\ning principles according to US GAAP and supplemented and \ncommented on by the JPM Group’s “Accounting Policies” \ndepartment. Here, too, stipulations are made with regard to \nthe JPM Group accounting practices. As part of the prepara-\ntion of the annual financial statements according to HGB and \nthe IFRS individual financial statements for J.P. Morgan SE, \na reconciliation is made from US GAAP to the HGB and IFRS \nfinancial statements. Local work directives regulate the formal \nrequirements and the material information in the annual finan-\ncial statements and in the IFRS separate financial statements, \nrespectively.\ning these risks. The internal control system (“ICS”) and the \nrisk management system, which cover the J.P. Morgan SE \naccounting process, focus on the guidelines, procedures and \nmeasures taken to ensure the efficacy, economic viability \nand orderliness of the accounting as well as guaranteeing \nadherence to the key statutory regulations. The ICS consists of \ntwo areas, namely Control, and Monitoring. In organizational \nterms, the Financial Control & Tax division is responsible for \nthe control.\nThe Monitoring measures consist of elements integrated into \nthe process as well as external and independent elements. \nAmong other factors, the integrated measures include a \nmonthly control process covering all of the Bank’s activities, \nduring which the balance sheet as at that date and the income \nstatement are examined to assess and confirm their correct \npresentation and risks. Moreover, in all instances the four-eye \nprinciple is applied, along with technical controls, mainly by \nsoftware-controlled audit mechanisms. In addition, qualified \nstaff members with due expertise and specialist functions \nsuch as Financial Control & Tax take part in the process-inte-\ngrated monitoring and control functions.\nThe Management Board and the Supervisory Board (in partic-\nular the Audit Committee) as well as the internal audit depart-\nment are engaged in the internal monitoring system in the \nform of process-independent audit measures. The audit of the \nannual financial statements constitutes a key element of pro-\ncess-independent monitoring.

Energy prices will remain \nhigh, and many companies, especially those dependent on \nexporting, will have to adapt as recent geopolitical develop-\nments could have a particularly negative long-term impact \non Europe owing to its dependency on the global East and \nSouth for imports of raw materials, exports of finished goods \nand services.\nRising defaults and negative rating actions on European \nhigh-yield bond and leveraged loan issuers towards the end \nof 2023 indicated continuing cost pressures and weaker \nsales volumes. In early 2024, several bond and loan issu-\ners entered restructuring processes or hired advisors. The \ngeneral consensus is that bond and loan defaults will rise \nfurther in 2024. \nGeopolitical risks in Ukraine and the Middle East remain ele-\nvated and with the increasingly firm resolve of the European \nCommission to confront Russia (and perhaps even China), \nEurope is upping geopolitical risk factors for its economy. The \nU.S. versus China trade dispute could also possibly intensify. \nThe interdependencies of ongoing crises around the world \ncould impact the markets in 2024. \nPotential setbacks in the conflict with Russia and transition \nto a multipolar world likely would exert further political and \neconomic pressures within Europe. One should keep in mind \nthat with the fall of the Soviet bloc and transition to a unipolar \nworld, some 25 new countries (as political entities) emerged. \nIt should not be inconceivable that a partial reversion to a \nmultipolar world could similarly lead to a reshaping of geo-\npolitical arrangements.\n5.

Industry Trends\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Factors\nFollowing subdued growth last year, the EU economy has \nentered 2024 on a weaker footing than expected. After nar-\nrowly avoiding a technical recession in the second half of \nlast year, prospects for the EU economy in the first quarter \nof 2024 remain weak. The long-standing effects of years of \nexpansionary monetary and financial policy will shape the \neconomy in 2024. Even though the successive interest rate \nrises that were implemented in a short time period seem \npoised to be reversed sooner or later, the interest rate envi-\nronment is completely different to what Western countries \nhave experienced in the recent past and a quick recovery \nseems unlikely.\nInflation has generally improved in the USA and Europe, giv-\ning the central banks opportunity to lower interest rates.

AI now holds defensive potential and can be valuable \nfor cybersecurity controls. AI can analyze network traffic in \nreal-time and identify potential security threats. We can also \nutilize AI to detect behavior that aligns with malicious activ-\nity, aiding in proactive defense measures. However, this also \nmeans that adversaries of all skill levels will find it easier to \ncarry out cyberattacks using AI. \nThe cybersecurity outlook for J.P. Morgan SE and the finan-\ncial sector for 2024 will be driven, in large part, by the con-\ntinued geopolitical instability and socioeconomic volatility \nthat businesses continue to face. Geopolitical tensions have \nrisen globally, impacting the digital realm. Nation-states may \nemploy tactics such as extortion, ransomware, disruptive \nattacks on critical infrastructure, intellectual property theft \nand supply chain attacks to achieve their geopolitical goals. \nDisinformation campaigns will continue to undermine public \ntrust and influence public opinion.

Despite challenging \nmacroeconomic conditions, especially from the geopolitical \nbackdrop), we expect that sustainability will remain a mega-\ntrend which will continue to shape the finance industry. The \ngrowth in ESG strategies has been supported by record levels \nof sustainable financing and the evolving regulatory frame-\nwork in Europe and beyond, which are increasingly focusing \non corporate disclosures. \nClimate change remains the primary focus of many ESG \nstrategies, and we expect that investors are increasingly \nfocusing on credible transition strategies in highly-exposed \nsectors such as oil & gas and cement. But in the end, climate \nchange impacts every industry sector, including the financial \nindustry. We see new business opportunities for the Bank \nto support companies that are thinking strategically about \nthis transition and that are positioning themselves to adapt \nto sustainably focused trends over time. For J.P. Morgan SE \nthis transformation process is led by the ESG Coordinator that \nreports directly to the Bank’s CEO. Oversight of these risks is \npart of the schedule of responsibilities of our Management \nBoard.

Through our diverse \nbusinesses and tailored solutions spanning investment and \ncommercial banking, payments processing and wealth man-\nagement, we are relentlessly focused on serving our clients, \nwhich acts as a solid baseline for the execution of our business \nstrategy in the next years, allowing us to not only defend our \nmarket position in EEA, but also to expand, where possible.\nJPMSE will continue its plans to launch a digital retail bank \nin Germany under the Group-wide Chase brand in 2024, with \nBerlin as the headquarters for Chase in Germany.\nDue the strategic role of JPMSE as EU intermediate pub-\nlic undertaking (“IPU”) for the Firm, we also anticipate a \ngrowing involvement in other strategic initiatives, including \nacquisitions.\nFor 2024, we expect moderate growth in Profit before Tax \n(“PBT”) in comparison to 2023. We continue to expect our \nTier 1 Capital Ratio to stay around 20%, and the Total Cap-\nital Ratio to remain around 35%. This offers us an adequate \ncapital buffer and to efficiently pursue our strategic goals \nincluding new business opportunities. Based on the Financial \nplan for 2024, our profitability indicators, namely Cost-Income \nratio, Return on Equity and Return on RWA, show a marginal \nimprovement from last year.\nAnti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing and \nSanctions\nIn the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, \nthe European Union is making further progress with the EU \nanti-money laundering (“AML”) package, which was launched \nin 2021. With the 6th AML Directive, a regulation on the cre-\nation of the anti-money laundering authority (“AMLA”) and a \nfurther regulation on the prevention of the use of the finan-\ncial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist \nfinancing, continue to be in final negotiations between the \nco-legislators.\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine as well as the \nerupting conflict in the Middle East means that the finan-\ncial services sector will continue to be engaged with the \nimplementation of financial sanctions. The implementation \nin J.P Morgan SE generally has a cross-LOB and functional \nimpact. Even though Global Financial Crimes Compliance \n(“GFCC”) acts as a standard setting function and translates \nthe regulatory requirements into internal policies, the oper-\national areas are entrusted with the compliance to these \npolicies.\nFurther focus areas\nNot only new or changed regulations can contribute to chang-\ning the regulatory environment of the Bank. Strategic aspects \nmay lead to change or the expansion of the business model \nand product range, which results in an extension of the reg-\nulatory horizon.\nIn general, the regulatory environment remains highly active \nand challenging, which is demonstrated by the published \nwork program for 2024 of the European Supervisory Author-\nities. Going forward, the Bank will continue to observe this",

While 2023’s uncertainties and \ngeopolitical conflicts remain present, the expectation of declining inflation and hope that interest rates have peaked are definitely \nsetting a better mood. With the improved market situation, financial investors will become more active in the market again. As  \na result, we expect fee levels to normalize for 2024.\nPayments\nAcknowledging that 2023 had been an exceptional year, we expect 2024 to remain strong in fee revenues, while anticipating  \na reduction in net interest income. Overall, we are confident that we are well positioned to drive digital transformation and \nfinancial innovation through data in line with the objective of the European Commission towards the interoperability of digital \npayment ecosystems and in line with our client needs for enhanced payment solutions. \nSecurities  \nServices\nThe Securities Services segment will continue to face the challenges of high competitive pressure with falling margins, high \ninvestments to ensure competitiveness and increasing regulatory requirements. Business opportunities are expected from our \ntechnologically best-in-class offering in the area of data and reporting, and our global and scalable product offering where we  \ncan offer market-leading solutions for all asset classes to our customers, combined with local support and expertise. Overall, we \nexpect marginal growth in fee revenues which is offset by continued margin pressure and slightly lower net interest income. \nMarkets\nTotal revenues for 2024 are planned to be moderately higher than 2023 Actuals. We are confident that we will be able to defend \nour top tier position in substantially all Markets businesses in Continental Europe. The digitalization of business processes,  \nthe rise of algorithmic trading and the development of ESG-related products will be, in our opinion, key differentiating drivers in \na highly competitive environment.\nCommercial \nBanking\nThe Commercial Banking segment is primarily a coverage organization, leveraging the product capabilities of the Corporate & \nInvestment Bank. The CCBSI Europe coverage team, which was launched in 2019, continues to expand into segments and \ngeographies. 2024 will be a continuation of investments made in prior years. Hence, we expect this segment to be one of the \nmost dynamic segments within JPMSE, subsequently translating into growth in operating income.\nPrivate Bank\nGlobal wealth will rise by 38% over the next five years, reaching $ 629 trillion by 2027. Growth by middle-income countries will \nbe the primary driver of global trends. We continue to invest in the Private Bank segment to grow our market share through \nlocal client advisory, continued high quality investment solutions and strategies, and regional expansion. Through continued \ninvestment in technology and the modernization of our platforms, we will also improve operational efficiencies and client \nexperience. As a result we expect a dynamic revenue growth over the next few years and an corresponding increase in our global \nPB market share.",

Market turbulences following the col-\nlapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the takeover of Credit Suisse \nby UBS also had limited impact on J.P. Morgan SE’s risk pro-\nfile. In May 2023, J.P. Morgan SE monitored developments and \nassessed the potential impacts of a US Debt Ceiling crisis event \nin line with the approach taken at Firmwide level. More broadly, \nJ.P. Morgan SE has implemented strategies, processes and con-\ntrols designed to respond to increased market volatility, client \ndemand for credit and liquidity, distress in certain industries \nor economic sectors and governmental actions, including the \nimposition of financial and economic sanctions. J.P. Morgan SE \nhas also kept under observation the developments in the real \nestate markets where it operates, cognizant of the sudden val-\nuation corrections that may be caused by adverse changes in \nmarket conditions. In particular, J.P. Morgan SE has observed \nthe developments in the commercial real estate markets, where \nrisks are posed by a host of factors like: the structural decline \nin demand, especially in the office and retail property seg-\nments; the significant increase in construction costs due to \nrising energy costs and the tightening of financing conditions \nfollowing the sharp interest rates increase. \nIn October 2023, the JPMCB NA Paris Branch portfolio was \nmigrated into J.P. Morgan SE; the migration led to further \nexpansion, mainly within the Private Banking business, while \nleaving the risk profile of the entity unchanged, as illustrated \nby the risk type-level analysis conducted by the entity after \nthe migration. More generally, following the merger in 2022, \nthe entity has continued to enhance its already established \ninternal processes for the management of the risk profile, for \nexample, enhancements to risk inventory post the merger and \nto risk taxonomy/risk classification.\n6. Risk Report\n6.1. RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk is an inherent part of the business activities of J.P. Mor-\ngan SE (“the entity”) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“the Firm”). \nWhen J.P. Morgan SE extends a loan, makes markets in secu-\nrities, or offers other products or services, it takes on some \ndegree of risk. The overall objective is to manage its business, \nand the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the \ninterests of its clients, customers and investors and protecting \nthe safety and soundness of the entity and the Firm.\nEffective risk management in J.P. Morgan SE requires, among \nother things:\n– \u0007Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and \nescalation of risks, by all individuals within the entity;\n– \u0007Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and man-\nagement within each of the lines of business (LOBs) and \nCorporate functions; and\n– \u0007Independent risk governance which is embedded into Firm-\nwide risk governance and oversight structure as appropriate.\nThe entity and the Firm strive for continual improvement in \ntheir efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training \nand development, talent retention, and other measures.\nJ.P. Morgan SE Risk Management has remained focused on \nserving its stakeholders. Over the course of 2023, the entity \nhas continued to monitor the potential secondary impacts of \nthe Russia-Ukraine crisis and their effects on the risk profile \nof J.P. Morgan SE.

Quantitative parameters are \nused to monitor and measure J.P. Morgan SE’s risk bearing \ncapacity consistent with its stated risk appetite. Qualitative \nRisk Appetite assessment and monitoring protocol leverage \non the Firmwide Qualitative Risk Appetite Framework, but are \ntailored to J.P. Morgan SE’s own business profile, governance, \nregional footprint and scale of activities.\nRisk appetite is set for the material risks.

Risk \nappetite must always be defined to be below Risk Capacity and \nincorporate a buffer deemed prudent by the J.P. Morgan SE \nManagement Board. The buffer may be expressed in absolute \nor relative terms and may be lower than the “business as \nusual” buffer that management adheres to outside of a stress \nperiod. Where applicable, risk appetite quantitative parame-\nters are expressed as losses under stress for individual risk \ntypes, which can be used by risk stripes to propose more \ngranular limits calibrated to these risk appetite levels.\nQuantitative Risk Appetite thresholds were calibrated to \naccount for the updated business strategy and increased risk \nsensitivities coming into the entity. The operationalization of \nRisk Appetite remains the same and calibration was carried \nout on stress results as the maximum amount of risk J.P. Mor-\ngan SE is willing to take.\n6.3. J.P. MORGAN SE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n6.3.1. Risk Identification\nPart of J.P. Morgan SE’s risk management framework is the \nidentification of risks, as well as the design and execution of \ncontrols, inclusive of Risk Management-specified controls, \nto manage those risks. To support this activity, J.P. Mor-\ngan SE has established a risk inventory procedure which \nis based on the Firmwide risk identification framework. It \nis designed to supplement the existing risk management \nprocesses by providing a means to comprehensively and \nconsistently document material risks that are inherent in \nthe entity’s business.\nThe classification of individual risk categories as a material risk \nis based on whether the occurrence of the risk could have a \nserious negative effect on J.P. Morgan SE’s risk-bearing capac-\nity, liquidity or capital situation or profitability. The materiality \nthresholds are recalibrated on an annual basis to consider the \nsize, business model and complexity of the legal entity. \nAs per the risk inventory dated December 31, 2023, the follow-\ning risk categories are considered material for J.P. Morgan SE:\n– \u0007Credit and investment risk including wholesale credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk and investment portfolio risk (pen-\nsion risk);\n– \u0007Market risk, including interest rate risk in the banking book \n(IRRBB) and credit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB);\n– Operational risk; and\n– \u0007Strategic risk including capital risk, business risk and \nliquidity risk.\nThe materiality assessment follows a gross approach (i.e. \nwithout taking into account actions designed to mitigate the \nunderlying risks) and is forward-looking (1-year horizon) to",

The purpose of these tools is to prevent insolvency or, \nshould insolvency occur, to minimize negative repercussions \nby preserving the systemically important functions of the \ninstitutions as well as preventing also the use of taxpayers’ \nmoney to the greatest extent possible.

The Recovery Plan is pre-\npared in compliance with the BRRD and its German transpo-\nsition, the German Act on the Recovery and Resolution of \nCredit Institutions (Gesetz zur Sanierung und Abwicklung \nJ.P. Morgan SE manages and mitigates each of its qualitative \nrisks down to appropriate levels by application of materially \neffective controls adequate to reduce risks where possible and \npractical. Factors that indicate a qualitative risk is “in excess” \nof these appropriate levels are for example:\n– \u0007Significant levels of risk that exist without mitigating controls; \n– \u0007Inability to monitor and evaluate either the risk or perfor-\nmance of controls through metrics; or \n– \u0007Indication of a breakdown in the business operating model \nrequiring significant changes to the business strategy, orga-\nnizational structure, and governance processes.\n6.3.3. Risk Measurement and Reporting\nRisk measurement and reporting in J.P. Morgan SE are per-\nformed by risk category on a daily (credit, capital, market, and \nliquidity risk), monthly (IRRBB, country and conduct risk) or \nquarterly cycle (CSRBB, operational, model, climate, reputa-\ntion, business and pension risks). The Internal Capital (ICAAP) \nand Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) \nis refreshed on a quarterly basis. All risk reports are subject \nto the data governance policy and the BCBS 239 framework.\nIn addition to regulatory limits, the Management Board at \nJ.P. Morgan SE has defined a series of early warning indi-\ncators, which are monitored in a timely manner. Indicators \nand risk limits are clearly documented and include inter alia \nrecovery indicators, credit limits, investment limits, bidding \nlimits, position limits, as well as the minimum liquidity of \nJ.P. Morgan SE. These also consider concentration risk with \nrespect to other entities of the Firm.\nFor its meetings, the Management Board receives a detailed \nmonthly overview of the development of the business areas, \ninformation on financial trends, a detailed risk report as well",

The Recovery Plan complies also \nwith the relevant European Commission Delegated Regula-\ntions, the Guidelines of the European Banking Authority (EBA) \nand incorporates feedback provided by the ECB on the 2022 \nRecovery Plan submission. The 2023 J.P. Morgan SE Recovery \nPlan aligns to the methodology and framework adopted in \nthe JPMorgan Chase & Co. Global Recovery Plan and other \nrecovery planning exercises within the EMEA region and tak-\ning into account the global set-up and interconnectedness \nbetween J.P. Morgan’s entities. This approach ensures JPMSE \nadopts a Recovery Plan governance model consistent with \nthe approach adopted in the Firmwide recovery governance \nmodel, which enables the local JPMSE team to ensure con-\nsistency across the different recovery plans while taking into \naccount the relevant local regulatory requirements. \nThe financial crisis also showed that EU authorities lacked the \ntools and preparation to wind down institutions in an orderly \nmanner, therefore a cross-border resolution mechanism has \nbeen established via the BRRD, and also the Single Resolu-\ntion Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), providing the resolution \nauthorities with comprehensive powers and resolution tools to \nintervene when an institution is deemed failing or likely to fail \n(FOLTF) and subsequently meets the conditions for resolution. \nThe Single Resolution Board (SRB), in cooperation with BaFin \nas the National Resolution Authority (NRA), is responsible for \npreparing J.P. Morgan SE’s resolution plans by outlining the \nrespective Preferred Resolution Strategy (PRS) and detailing \nhow J.P. Morgan SE could be resolved by implementing the \nrelevant resolution tool(s), while ensuring taxpayers avoid car-\nrying the financial burden of the institution’s failure. \nLikewise it determines the institution’s Minimum Require-\nments for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), the pur-\npose of which is to ensure that an institution has sufficient loss \nabsorbing and recapitalization capacity at all times, which can \ncredibly and feasibly be written down or converted into equity \nin case of resolution. \nIn 2023, as part of the SRB’s Multi-Annual Work Program, \nJ.P. Morgan SE continued to take relevant steps to build up \nand demonstrate resolution capabilities across dimensions \nsuch as governance, loss absorbing capacity, liquidity and \nfunding, operational continuity in resolution (OCIR), access \nto financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and Communica-\ntion in order to meet the SRB’s Expectations for Banks (EfB), \nwhich requires institutions to be fully resolvable, and plans \nto demonstrate this to the SRB by end of July 2024. Addition-\nally, J.P. Morgan SE continued to test the operationalization \nof its resolution plan, via testing of the above dimensions, as \nrequired by the SRB, and in anticipation of the SRB shifting \nfocus towards this priority in the coming years.\n6.4. INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT \n­PROCESS (ICAAP)\nThe ICAAP including the risk bearing capacity analysis is a \nkey steering instrument at J.P. Morgan SE with the goal of \nmaintaining, at all times, an appropriate risk profile, adequate \ncapitalization and thereby ensuring business continuity on an \nongoing basis.\nThe normative perspective is a multi-year assessment of \nJ.P. Morgan SE’s ability to meet all capital-related regulatory \nand supervisory requirements on an ongoing basis under a \nbaseline and adverse scenarios.\nThe economic perspective assesses capital adequacy, cover-\ning all material risks, over a 1-year horizon using internal \nquantification methodologies and an internal definition of \neconomic capital resources.",

The risk limits which are set below \nthe Risk Appetite introduce additional levels of escalation. \nFurther details can be found in the section “Risk Appetite”.\n– \u0007Capital planning: The capital plan is compatible with \nJ.P. Morgan SE’s business strategy, risk appetite and capital \nresources. Internally set targets and limits of capital ade-\nquacy metrics constitute constraints in order to safeguard \ncapital adequacy on a forward-looking basis.\n– \u0007Stress testing: Capital adequacy metrics both under the nor-\nmative and the economic perspective are subject to regular \nstress testing to evaluate J.P. Morgan SE’s capital position \nand detect key vulnerabilities. Capital plan figures are con-\nsidered under various tailored adverse scenarios in order to \nassess the resiliency of J.P. Morgan SE and the viability of \nits business strategy.\n– \u0007Reverse stress testing: Reverse stress testing is a risk man-\nagement tool which aims to improve the awareness of cur-\nrent and potential vulnerabilities, by assessing which sce-\nnarios may lead the entity to the point of non-viability. The \nReverse Stress Test is an integral part of J.P. Morgan SE’s \nstress testing and is carried out as part of the ICAAP on \nan annual basis. This analysis is performed on a risk-by-\nrisk basis and takes into account the nature, size, scale and \ncomplexity of J.P. Morgan SE’s business activities and risks. \nThe list of potential scenarios and relative assumptions is the \nresult of an assessment which considers all type of external \nadverse events, as well as the J.P. Morgan SE-specific risk \nfactors, events and circumstances that could cause the busi-\nness model of the entity to become unviable.\n– \u0007Capital adequacy assessment: J.P. Morgan SE’s Manage-\nment Board produces and signs annually a Capital Adequacy \nStatement (CAS) reflecting its view on capital adequacy, \nwhich is linked to specific conclusions and management \nactions to be taken to safeguard capital adequacy on a for-\nward-looking basis.\nJ.P. Morgan SE’s ICAAP architecture consists of several build-\ning blocks which coherently fit together and ensure that \nJ.P. Morgan SE maintains at all times sufficient capital to cover \nthe risks that it is exposed to.\n– \u0007Risk identification and assessment: This forms the basis of the \nICAAP and results in an inventory of risks to which J.P. Mor-\ngan SE is exposed to. These risks are subsequently assessed \nfor materiality based on defined materiality thresholds. Fur-\nther details can be found in the section “Risk Identification”.\n– \u0007Risk quantification: Under the economic perspective and by the \nusage of internal quantification methodologies, J.P. Morgan SE \nquantifies material risks that may cause economic losses and \ndeplete internal capital. In order to determine the regulatory \ncapital demand, the quantification of risks in the normative \nperspective follows regulatory and accounting rules. Capital \nis held against all material risks except for those that cannot \nbe adequately covered by capital, e.g. liquidity risk. However, \nany spill over effects on capital are taken into consideration.\n– \u0007Capital resources: The available capital resources represent the \namount of capital available to absorb unexpected losses and \nmeet regulatory requirements on capital. A significant portion of \nJ.P. Morgan SE’s capital resources is in the form of Tier 1 capital \nwhich is the capital form capable of absorbing losses in a busi-\nness continuity environment. While the normative perspective \nutilizes regulatory capital aligned with CRR rules and accounting \nstandards, the economic perspective employs a more conser-\nvative definition of capital resources building on the normative \nperspective whereby only capital items capable of absorbing \nlosses in a business continuity environment are considered.\n– \u0007Risk appetite: J.P. Morgan SE has established a risk appetite \nframework which expresses the level of risk J.P. Morgan SE is \nwilling to take to achieve its strategic objectives.

Further, the ICAAP as a key \nrisk management instrument is at least refreshed and reported \nto the management body on a quarterly basis.\n6.4.1. Normative Perspective\nJ.P. Morgan SE can, from a capital adequacy perspective, \ncomfortably execute its business strategy for 2024 – 2026. \nAccording to its capital plan, J.P. Morgan SE’s Tier 1 ratio is \nnot expected to fall below 19% and the Total Capital ratio not \nbelow 33% in the next three years.\nCapital methodologies in the normative perspective\n– \u0007Credit Risk and Counterparty Credit Risk: J.P. Morgan SE \napplies the standardized approach (CRSA of CRR) to calcu-\nlate its pillar 1 capital requirements for credit risk. External \ncredit ratings are used to determine the credit quality steps \nand the associated risk weights based on the exposure class. \nThe risk weights are then applied to the exposure to derive \nrisk weighted assets (RWAs).\n\t\n• \u0007For OTC derivatives, both the internal model method \n(IMM) and SA-CCR are used to calculate exposure.\n\t\n• \u0007For securities financing and other collateralized trans-\nactions, the financial collateral comprehensive method, \nincluding supervisory volatility adjustments, is used to \ncalculate exposure values. \n– \u0007Market Risk: J.P. Morgan SE currently uses the standard-\nized approach to calculate its regulatory market risk capital \nrequirements. Capital requirements for FX risk, Interest Rate \nrisk, Equity risk, and Commodity risk are calculated and \naggregated without consideration of diversification effects. \nThe calculation depends on the underlying product and risk \nand can be split into the following main sub risk types:\n\t\n• \u0007Interest Rate Risk: J.P. Morgan SE uses the maturity \napproach, but for sub-sets of products, it has received \nthe permission by the ECB to apply sensitivity models \nfor interest rate risk in 2021.\n\t\n• \u0007Equity Risk: The standardized approach is used with a \nlook-through for stock indices for the purposes of spe-\ncific and general equity risks.\n\t\n• \u0007Commodity Risk: The maturity ladder approach is used \nto calculate capital requirements.\n\t\n• \u0007Non-delta risks (i.e. gamma and vega): The entity uses \nboth the Delta-Plus method and the equity asset class \nscenario approach to quantify non-delta risks.\n– \u0007Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Risk: J.P. Morgan SE cur-\nrently uses the standardized approach to calculate a CVA \nrisk charge for OTC derivatives. Both the Internal Model \nMethod (IMM) as well as SA-CCR are used to calculate the \nexposures. \n– \u0007Operational Risk: Under the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) \nas defined in the CRR, the capital requirement is equal to \n15% of the average over the previous three years of the \nrelevant indicator. J.P. Morgan SE applies currently until \n2023 the modified BIA for calculating its OpRisk-RWA, where \nalso forward-looking revenues are used instead of historical \nrevenues. This approach avoids an underestimation of the \nOpRisk RWA during this transitional phase where historical \nrevenues aren’t representative of the current state of the \nentity following the transformation it has undergone through \nBrexit and the completed merger into J.P. Morgan SE. Start-\ning from 2024, J.P. Morgan SE will use the BIA with the \nhistorical revenues for calculating the OpRisk RWA.\n6.4.2.

Internal Capital Resources\nJ.P. Morgan SE uses its regulatory own funds as a starting \npoint for deriving its internal capital. Adjustments are made \nfor positions that do not reflect the fair value concept under-\nlying the economic perspective. Furthermore, capital items \nthat do not provide loss absorbing capacity in a going concern \nsituation (e.g. Tier 2 capital) are de-recognized for internal \ncapital purposes.\nIn J.P. Morgan SE’s view, all risks are adequately covered \nby capital and the capital in the entity is of high quality as it \nmainly consists of CET1 capital.\n6.5. RISK CATEGORIES\nThe following paragraphs provide details of the individual \nrisk types. The 2023 Risk Management Report is aligned with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standard 7 (IFRS 7) Finan-\ncial Instruments: Disclosures. Key sections include financial \ninstruments grouped appropriately to the nature of the infor-\nmation presented and aligned with audited financial reports. \nThe report also contains key figures which are referenced to \nthe Pillar 3 of Basel 3 information published in the Financial \nReporting section of the J.P. Morgan SE. \n6.5.1. Credit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in \ncredit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. J.P. Mor-\ngan SE is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lend-\ning, market-making, capital markets and hedging activities \nwith and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its \noperating services activities (such as cash management and \nclearing activities), securities financing activities, and cash \nplaced with banks.\nJ.P. Morgan SE Credit Risk’s overall strategy is to manage \nrisks arising from the execution of the business strategy in a \nmanner that balances serving the interest of its clients, cus-\ntomers and investors and protects the safety and soundness \nof the entity. To achieve this, J.P. Morgan SE Credit Risk seeks \nto maintain a risk profile that is diversified in terms of obligor \ntype and rating, product type, industry, credit family, collateral \nand geographic concentration. \nCredit Risk Management\nCredit Risk Management is an independent risk management \nfunction that monitors, measures and manages credit risk in \nJ.P. Morgan SE and defines credit risk framework and proce-\ndures. This includes:\n– Maintaining a credit risk management framework;\n– \u0007Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across \nall portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure \napprovals;\n– \u0007Setting industry and geographical concentration limits as \nappropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines;",

The \nECL is calculated for financial instruments valued at amortized \ncost or FVOCI. For financial instruments in Levels 1 and 2, the \ncalculation is model-based, while for financial instruments in \nLevel 3, the ECL is generally determined individually. Level 1 as \nperforming instruments, level 2 as performing instruments that \nhave experienced a Significant Increase in Credit Risk since \ninitial recognition and level 3 as non-performing instruments.\nThe measurement of ECLs reflects an unbiased and proba-\nbility-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a \nrange of possible outcomes. To this end J.P. Morgan SE uses \nfive economic scenarios and calculates the ECL by weighting \nthe outcomes.\nThe effects of the prevailing economic environment are \ncaptured in macroeconomic scenarios which in turn are \nreflected in the calculation of ECLs. Additionally, similar to \n2022, J.P. Morgan SE has decided to retain the adjustment to \n– \u0007Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection \nwith the approval of credit exposure;\n– Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans; and\n– \u0007Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit \nrisk-based capital management.\nThe comprehensive Firmwide Credit Risk Framework is sup-\nplemented by regional frameworks as required. As such, \nJ.P. Morgan SE’s Credit Risk Management framework sup-\nplements the Firmwide credit risk policy framework and is \napproved by J.P. Morgan SE’s Management Board and the \nROC. It specifies that credit decisions are made on the basis \nof clearly-defined, separate responsibilities for “Front Office” \n(“Markt”) and “Back Office” (“Marktfolge”) as well as the pro-\ncess of assigning and managing credit authorities in connec-\ntion with the approval of all credit exposure.\nRisk appetite \nJ.P. Morgan SE Quantitative Risk Appetite framework incorpo-\nrates Net Charge-Off (NCO) parameters for Credit Risk, includ-\ning projections under relative adverse stress scenario for \nWholesale NCOs.

Credit risk measurement employs several methodol-\nogies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty \ndefault. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depend-\ning on several factors, including type of asset, risk measure-\nment parameters, and risk management and collection pro-\ncesses.

Instru-\nments in scope for TCP include loans and lending-related \ncommitments stemming from extensions of credit to borrow-\ners; whereas Non-TCP includes, but is not limited to, other \ndebt instruments valued at amortized cost such as reverse \nrepurchase agreements and margin loans.\nThe determination of the ECL is based on the Staging of finan-\ncial instruments. Stage 1 captures the instruments for which \ncredit risk has reduced or has not significantly increased since \ninitial balance sheet recognition. The ECL for Stage 1 assets \nis the expected credit losses over the next year (12-month \nECL). Stage 2 captures the instruments for which credit risk \nhas increased significantly since initial balance sheet recogni-\ntion. The ECL for Stage 2 assets considers the expected credit \nlosses over the entire residual term of the instrument (Lifetime \nECL).

If the present value of \nexpected cash flows is less than the gross carrying amount of \nthe instrument, the ECL is equal to the shortfall.\nIn determining how exposures should be grouped for collec-\ntive valuation, J.P. Morgan SE considers many factors includ-\ning, but not limited to, internal credit ratings, loan duration, \nborrower country, and industry sector. Internal risk assess-\nments generally correspond to those defined by Standard & \nPoor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service.\nDuring the course of the year, Expected Credit Losses arising \nfrom loans and other lending-related commitments decreased to \n€ 220 million at the end of March, then rose to € 244 million by \nend of June, at the end of September the ECL decreased to € 190 \nmillion and by year-end it rose to € 229 million. The fluctuation \nis mainly caused by idiosyncratic movements of exposures and \nratings. At year-end, allowance for credit losses of non-perform-\ning loan (NPL) was € 30.8 million, while recovery for the year \ntotalled € 13.4 million, across five of the NPL positions.\nModelling approach used for calculation of Stage 1  \nand Stage 2 allowances\nJ.P. Morgan SE uses the models of the Firm to determine \nthe ECL results for the credit portfolio.

The process assesses \nthe potential impact of alternative economic and business sce-\nnarios on estimated credit losses for J.P. Morgan SE.\nEconomic scenarios and the underlying parameters are \ndefined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic fac-\ntors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results \nmay indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends \nand potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the \nperiodic stress testing processes, management also considers \nadditional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry \nand country specific stress scenarios, as necessary. Stress test-\ning is used to inform decisions on setting risk appetite, as well \nas to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.\nCredit Risk Approval and Control\n– \u0007Approval of clients: All clients are subject to credit analysis \nand financial review by Credit Risk Management before new \nbusiness is accepted.\n– \u0007Establishment of credit lines: All credit exposure must be \napproved in advance by a J.P. Morgan SE Credit Officer with \nthe level of credit authority required by the applicable credit \nauthority grid. Such approvals, together with details of the \ncredit limits, are recorded in the Credit Systems.\n– \u0007In certain instances, credit lines can be approved according \nto predetermined rules that are subject to annual review by \nthe appropriate J.P. Morgan SE Credit Officers and the CRO \nof J.P. Morgan SE.",

Intraday overdrafts can arise from \nusage of an intraday facility, a credit approved excess usage \nof the intraday facility, or a credit approved payment outflow \nwhere there is no facility. Intraday overdrafts become over-\nnight overdrafts if the account is not fully funded by close \nof business. Overnight overdrafts result from account debits \nexceeding fully available account credits by close of busi-\nness, generating Primary Credit Exposure. Intraday transac-\ntions are monitored and actioned, as appropriate. Any expo-\nsure which exceeds a facility and is outside of a tolerance \nrange requires the approval of an authorized Credit Officer.\nRisk Monitoring and Management\nJ.P.  Morgan  SE implements policies and practices devel-\noped by the Firm. The credit risk governance documents are \ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity of the \napproval and decision-making process for extending credit so \nthat credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, \nmonitored regularly and managed actively at both the trans-\naction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes \ncredit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating \nmethodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines \nfor management of distressed exposures.\nIn addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in \nevaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently vali-\ndated by groups separate from the LOBs.\nAs part of its management of credit and counterparty credit \nexposures, credit risk mitigation techniques are actively used \nto reduce the amount of credit risk, to spread the concentration \nof risk across the portfolio, and ultimately to ensure efficient \nuse of capital in compliance with the applicable regulations. \nThis is accomplished through a number of means, including \nreceipt of collateral, master netting agreements, guarantees \nand credit derivatives and other risk-reduction techniques.\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a few clients, counter-\nparties or customers are engaged in similar business activities \nor activities in the same geographic region, or when they have \nsimilar economic features that would cause their ability to meet \ncontractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in \neconomic conditions. J.P. Morgan SE regularly monitors various \nsegments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk \nconcentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed \nnecessary and permitted under J.P. Morgan SE’s agreements. \nSenior management is involved in the credit approval and \nreview process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect \nJ.P. Morgan SE’s risk appetite. Credit risk is monitored regularly \nat an aggregate portfolio, product, segment, industry and indi-\nvidual client and counterparty level with established concentra-\ntion limits that are reviewed and revised as deemed appropriate \nby management, typically on an annual basis. Industry and coun-\nterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic \nrisk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints.\nWrong-way risk is actively monitored. J.P. Morgan SE may be \nexposed to additional credit risk as a result of the wrong way \nnature of certain OTC Derivatives, Cleared Derivatives, Futures & \nOptions and Securities Financing trades, or the wrong way \nnature of collateral taken against these trades. Specific Wrong \nWay Risk (SWWR) is when the potential exposure on a transac-\ntion with a counterparty is highly and adversely correlated with \nthe counterparty’s creditworthiness. This risk is generally mea-\nsured on the basis of an immediate jump-to-default assumption. \nGeneral Wrong Way Risk (GWWR) arises for a given counterparty \nwhen the exposure and likelihood of default of the counterparty \nare positively correlated with general market risk factors.",

Liquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk considers the risk of J.P. Morgan SE becoming \nunable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obli-\ngations as they arise or that it does not have the appropri-\nate amount, composition and tenor of funding to support its \nassets and liabilities. The risk arises as a result of the business \nactivities undertaken by the entity, and is primarily driven by \nsecured funding outflows, intraday risk contingent outflows \nrelated to derivatives, outflows from third party client deposits \nand a drawdown of commitments.\nThe primary Liquidity Risk Strategy of J.P. Morgan SE is to \nensure that the entity has sufficient amount, adequate compo-\nsition and tenor of funding to support its assets and liabilities, \nits core businesses can operate in support of client needs \nand that the entity can meet contractual and contingent obli-\ngations through normal economic cycles and during stress \nevents.\nSpecifically, this is achieved by managing the liquidity surplus \nunder an array of adverse scenarios, such that it never falls \nbelow a minimum required buffer. The minimum required \nCredit Spread Risk in the Banking Book (CSRBB)\nIn October 2022, the EBA published the guidelines on the \nmanagement of interest rate risk and credit spread risk aris-\ning from non-trading book activities (EBA/GL/2022/14). The \nguidelines expanded on CSRBB related language as compared \nto prior guidelines, requiring the inclusion of CSRBB in the risk \nframework of regulated entities by the end of 2023.\nJ.P. Morgan SE’s Management Board has delegated indepen-\ndent day-to-day oversight of CSRBB within the entity to the \nJ.P. Morgan SE ROC, which is chaired by the J.P. Morgan SE \nCRO.

The Control Management Organization, \nwhich consists of control managers within each LOB and \nCorporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the \nJ.P. Morgan SE CCOR Management Framework.\nThe J.P. Morgan SE Head Quarter Location Operational Risk \nand Control Committee (“LORCC”) receives reports on qual-\nity and stability of processes, addressing key operational risk \nissues, focusing on processes with control concerns, and over-\nseeing control remediation.\nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and Firm-\nwide Risk Executive (“FRE”) for operational risk and qualitative \nrisk appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management \nFramework and establishing minimum standards for its execu-\ntion. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report \nto the Global CCO and FRE for operational risk and qualitative \nrisk appetite and are independent of the respective businesses \nor functions they oversee. At J.P. Morgan SE, the Operational \nRisk Officer (“ORO”) reports to the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). \nThe CRO has delegated establishment of the J.P. Morgan SE \nCCOR Framework to the J.P. Morgan SE CCO and ORO.\nThe Firm’s CCOR Management Framework is included in the \nRisk Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and \napproved by the Board Risk Committee. The J.P. Morgan SE \nCredit Ratings\nThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit \nratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse \neffect on access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of \nfunds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements \nand decrease the number of investors and counterparties \nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the \nimpact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous con-\ntractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are \nincorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. \nBased on its internal and external liquidity stress testing, \nJ.P. Morgan SE maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a \npotential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings down-\ngrades of the Firm.\n6.5.5. Operational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting \nfrom inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, \nhuman factors, or external events impacting the Firm’s or \nthe entity’s processes or systems. Operational Risk includes \ncompliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model \nrisk.\nOperational risk is inherent in the entity’s activities and can \nmanifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, \nbusiness disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary \nevents beyond the control of the entity), cyberattacks, inap-\npropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable \nlaws, rules and regulations, inappropriate model application \nor failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform \nin accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Man-\nagement attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate \nlevels in light of the entity’s financial position, the charac-\nteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory \nenvironments in which it operates.",

Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of \nmanagement within the MRGR based on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the J.P. Morgan SE Estimations and Model Risk Man-\nagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as \nwell as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. \nIn certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the \npolicy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. \nMRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions \nto mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. \nThese actions will depend on the model and may include, for \nexample, limitation of trading activity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of impre-\ncision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or \neconomic environment. This is particularly true when the \ncurrent and forecasted environments are significantly dif-\nferent from the historical macroeconomic environments \nupon which the models were developed. This increased \nuncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment \nand analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may \nagement Policy and Procedure and follows the same princi-\nples and guidelines as laid out in the Firmwide Framework.\nManaging model risk throughout the model lifecycle is the \nresponsibility of multiple constituents, principally the model \nusers, model developers, model owners, and MRGR. The J.P. \nMorgan SE Estimations Risk Committee (SEERC), a sub-com-\nmittee of the J.P. Morgan SE ROC, is responsible for the over-\nsight of the model risk and implementation of the model risk \nframework for the entity.\nMRGR sets forth metrics and tolerances for various model risk \nmanagement activities. The extent to which metrics exceed \nor are within tolerances is an indicator of the aggregate level \nof model risk within J.P. Morgan SE.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models within the \nJ.P. Morgan SE based on the specific purposes of such models. \nUsers and developers of models are responsible for develop-\ning, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring \nmodels to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have \nbeen approved, model users and developers are responsible for \nmaintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor \nand evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. \nModel users and developers may seek to enhance models in \nresponse to changes in the relevant portfolios and in product \nand market developments, as well as to capture improvements in \navailable modelling techniques and systems capabilities. Model \nusers within J.P. Morgan SE are responsible for ensuring that any \nmodel they use is captured both in the Firmwide inventory and \nin the J.P. Morgan SE inventory and for abiding by the scope and \nother conditions of the model’s approval on an ongoing basis.\nMRGR within J.P. Morgan SE is an independent function report-\ning directly to the J.P. Morgan SE CRO, which is staffed with",

The increase of € 3.5 bil-\nlion comprises a € 1.2 billion net increase in CET1 driven by \nretained earnings from 2022 and a € 2.3 billion net increase \nin Tier 2 capital driven by a Tier 2 issuance (€ 2.5 billion) in \nMay 2023. Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2023 amounted \nto € 22.5 billion, consisting entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 \n(CET1) capital.\nDespite the increase in CET1 capital, the CET1 capital ratio \ndecreased to 18.6% from 19.7% in the prior year driven by \na € 13.2 billion increase in Risk Weighted Assets. The increase \nin RWAs is driven mainly by exposures to Corporates (€ +5 bil-\nlion) and securitization positions (€ +4.8 billion).\nLeverage Ratio decreased to 5.8% from 6.0% in the prior \nyear primarily driven by increased in leverage exposure (€ 32 \nbillion) for Derivatives and SFTs partially offset by the net \nincrease in Tier 1 capital mentioned above. \nThroughout the year 2023, regulatory capital ratios and lever-\nage ratio were comfortably above minimum requirements and \ninternal targets. The following table shows the RWAs and cap-\nital ratio development from 2022 to 2023. \nThe non-risk-based leverage ratio is intended to act as a sup-\nplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirements. \nIts objectives are to constrain the build-up of leverage in the \nbanking sector and to reinforce the risk-based requirements \nwith a simple, non-risk-based “backstop” measure. A min-\nimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.0% was introduced \neffective starting June 28, 2021, according to the CRR/CRD \nframework.\nMinimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities \n(MREL) Regulatory Requirements\nThe Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible \nLiabilities (MREL) represents the minimum amount of own \nfunds and eligible liabilities that an entity is required to \nmaintain so that it can absorb losses and have sufficient \nrecapitalization capacity in the event of a resolution. The \nMREL requirements are set by the Resolution Authority \nand consist of an RWA-based requirement (MREL-RWA) and \na leverage exposure-based requirement (MREL-LRE). Both \nrequirements consist of the sum of a loss absorption amount \n(LAA) and a recapitalization amount (RCA) and must be met \nin parallel. These requirements can be met with own funds \nand/or eligible liabilities (i.e. bail-inable liabilities meeting \ncertain eligibility requirements).\nGiven J.P. Morgan SE currently meets its MREL require-\nments solely with own funds (i.e. Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital), \nMREL-RWA has been the most binding constraint on capital \nsince January 2022, when the MREL requirements under \nthe Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive II (BRRD II) \ntook effect. In 2023, JPMSE’s MREL-RWA requirement as a \npercentage of total RWA was 28.1%.

This is \nreflected in the J.P. Morgan SE Business Strategy 2024 – 2026. \nThis strategy for managing Business Risk in J.P. Morgan SE \ntakes account of the range of uncertainties that can impact on \nkey planning assumptions and can lead to deviations between \nplanned and actual results. It is the role of the J.P. Morgan SE \nManagement Board to review business results and address \nany material deviations from the Business Plan and antici-\npated changes to the business profile that may require an \nupdate to the underlying assumptions.\n6.5.9. Pension Risk\nJ.P. Morgan SE defines pension risk as the risk caused by \ncontractual or other liabilities to, or with respect to, a pension \nscheme (whether established for its employees or those of \na related company or otherwise). Pension risk is driven by \nmarket and demographic risk where the pension scheme may \nbe unable to meet future expected benefit payments. Pension \nrisk therefore represents the potential necessity for increased \npension risk provisions.\nJ.P. Morgan SE manages pension risk with a dedicated pension \ngovernance framework. This includes regular reporting, a pen-\nsion committee and a corresponding investment committee.\nJ.P. Morgan SE’s pension schemes are exposed to significant \nfalls in equity and/or other risky asset markets, decreases in \nreal and/or nominal interest rates, and increases in inflation \nexpectations and life expectancy, each of which, or in com-\nbination, could lead to a pension capital shortfall and conse-\nquent impact to J.P. Morgan SE’s Profit and Loss.\nPension risk is quantified on the basis of a VaR model with a \n99.9% confidence level and a 1-year holding period, semi-an-\n2022. The leverage-based MREL regulatory requirements also \nincreased by € 1.9 billion YoY on increased leverage exposure. \nDespite these increases in the MREL requirements, J.P. Mor-\ngan SE maintained a surplus on MREL throughout 2023 and \ncontinued to actively manage its MREL requirements through \nidentification and implementation of RWA optimization actions.\n6.5.8. Business Risk\nJ.P. Morgan SE defines business risk as the risk associated \nwith J.P. Morgan SE’s current and future business plans and \nobjectives. Business risk includes the risk to current or antici-\npated earnings, capital, liquidity, enterprise value, or J.P. Mor-\ngan SE’s reputation arising from adverse business decisions, \npoor implementation of business decisions, or lack of respon-\nsiveness to changes in the industry or external environment. \nThe risk is driven by a combination of factors (internal and \nexternal) where unexpected changes could adversely impact \nthe ability of the LOBs to successfully implement their business \nstrategies and meet their targets. A regular comparison of the \nactuals with the plan, which might result in adjustments if \nnecessary, should minimize such deviations.\nThe business risk quantification process determines an \nadverse view on the planned P&L by estimating adverse effects \non P&L items. The methodology uses historically observed \nabsolute (weighted) deviations between planned and actual \nP&L figures and computes business risk factors by determin-\ning the 99.9th quantile from the empirical distribution. The \nbusiness risk factors include a 5% add-on and are applied to \nthe current P&L plan to obtain an estimate of the economic \ncapital requirement for business risk over a 1-year horizon. \nThis economic capital requirement for business risk results \ntogether with the other economic risk categories in the total \neconomic capital requirement of J.P. Morgan SE.",

Under the internal country \nrisk management approach, attribution of exposure to a specific \ncountry is based on the country where the largest proportion \nof the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is \nlocated or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived. \nThis may be different from the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or \ncountry of incorporation. Individual country exposures reflect an \naggregation of the entity’s risk to an immediate default, with zero \nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors \nattributed to that country. Assumptions are sometimes required \nin determining the measurement and allocation of country expo-\nsure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index prod-\nucts, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or \nguarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country. \nThe use of different measurement approaches or assumptions \ncould affect the amount of reported country exposure.\nUnder the internal country risk measurement framework:\n– \u0007Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances \nplaced with central banks, commercial banks, and other \nfinancial institutions;\n– \u0007Lending exposures are measured at the total committed \namount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for \nnually evaluated by J.P. Morgan SE’s pension administrator, \nand taken into account in a separate quantification.

Reputation Risk\nReputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may neg-\natively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and reduce \nconfidence in the Firm’s competence by various stakeholders, \nincluding clients, counterparties, customers, communities, \ninvestors, regulators, or employees. \nThe types of events that may result in reputation risk are \nwide-ranging and can be introduced by the Firm’s employ-\nees, business strategies and activities, clients, customers and \ncounterparties with which the Firm does business. These \nevents could contribute to financial losses, litigation, regula-\ntory enforcement actions, fines, penalties and other sanctions \nas well as other harm to the Firm. \nOrganization and Management\nReputation Risk Management is an independent risk manage-\nment function that establishes the governance framework for \nmanaging reputation risk across the Firm’s LOBs and Corpo-\nrate Functions. Reputation risk is inherently challenging to \nidentify, manage and quantify.\nThe Firm’s reputation risk management function includes the \nfollowing activities:\n– \u0007Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy \nand a standard consistent with the reputation risk frame-\nwork;\n– \u0007Providing oversight of the governance framework through \nprocesses and infrastructure to support consistent identifi-\ncredit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities \ncollateral received;\n– \u0007Securities financing exposures are measured at their receiv-\nable balance, net of eligible collateral received;\n– \u0007Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of \nall positions, including both long and short positions;\n– \u0007Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is mea-\nsured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of \nthe eligible collateral received; and\n– \u0007Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional \namount of protection purchased or sold, for the same under-\nlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the deriv-\native receivable or payable reflecting the manner in which \nthe Firm manages these exposures.\nSome activities may create contingent or indirect exposure \nrelated to a country (for example, providing clearing services \nor secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing \nreceivables).

J.P. Morgan SE \nhas adopted the Firmwide Reputation Risk governance frame-\nwork for the management of reputation risk within the entity. \nIt is the responsibility of each LOB, Corporate Function and \nemployees to consider the reputation of the Firm when decid-\ning whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or \nclient relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business \nprocess or consider any other activity. Environmental impacts \nand social concerns are increasingly important considerations \nin assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a component \nof the Firm’s reputation risk governance.\n6.6.3. Climate Risk\nClimate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of cli-\nmate change on J.P. Morgan SE’s clients, customers, oper-\nations and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a \ndriver of risk that may impact existing types of risks (credit \n& investment, market, operational and strategic) managed by \nJ.P. Morgan SE. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk \nand transition risk.\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss asso-\nciated with a changing climate.

The Firm believes that this practice helps support a \nrisk-aware business culture and an effective risk management \nprocess. J.P. Morgan SE leverages the Firmwide risk identi-\nfication framework and has integrated climate and environ-\nmental risk into its own risk identification framework as a \ndriver of existing credit & investment, market, operational and \nstrategic risk types. Supporting this framework is a classifi-\ncation system, illustrated below, that describes how climate \nand environmental risk drivers could translate into potential \nimpacts to our clients and our operations. JPMSE continues \nto systematically enhance the capture of climate and envi-\nronmental risks in the risk inventory. At the time of writing \nthis report, a significant extension of the approach is ongoing \nincluding, amongst others, the usage of heatmaps to scan for \npockets of climate and environmental risks. JPMSE expects \nthat C&E risks will be identified as material drivers of credit \nrisk.

The Firm uses internationally recognized scenarios \nMoreover, J.P. Morgan SE has completed an initial assessment \nof social and governance risks.\nScenario Analysis and Stress Testing\nJ.P. Morgan SE leverages the Firm’s capabilities in order to \nperform scenario analysis and stress testing exercises that \nScenario Analysis and Stress Testing\n¹ Temperature increases are relative to global mean temperatures at pre-industrial levels (1850 –1900).\nThe IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario represents the worst-case, highest emissions scenario. \nThe scenario assumes that global mean temperature reaches 4.4 °C warming above pre- \nindustrial levels by 2100 due to the continued exploitation of abundant fossil fuel \nresources and a continued rise in resource- and energy-intensive activities around the \nworld. Under this scenario, there is no transition to a low-carbon economy and GHG \nemissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century.\nThe NGFS Divergent Net Zero (“DNZE”) scenario represents the most severe  \ntransition risk scenario. The scenario assumes that global net zero is reached by 2050 \nthrough higher carbon prices with a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, despite divergence  \nin policies introduced by governments across the world. The scenario assumes that \nglobal warming is successfully limited to 1.5 °C by 2100, which limits physical risk \nimpacts.\nPhysical Risk Scenario Analysis\nTransition Risk Scenario Analysis\nThe Firm applies IPCC-derived \nphysical risk parameters to assess \nthe potential impacts of the in- \ncreasing frequency and severity of \nsevere weather events on its busi-\nness operations, credit exposures, \nand collateral locations. Con- \nsistent with the transition risk ap- \nproach, the Firm utilizes both a \n“baseline” physical risk scenario \nand a “severe” physical risk sce-\nnario to inform the range of out-\ncomes.\nThe Firm applies macroeconomic \nand industry-specific variables \n(e. g. Oil & Gas demand, steel pro-\nduction, etc.) from NGFS sce- \nnarios to help assess potential tran-\nsition risk impacts to the Firm. In \norder to quantify and understand \nthe range of these impacts, the \nFirm is using a “baseline” transi-\ntion risk scenario and a “severe” \ntransition risk scenario from the \nNGFS.\nThe IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (“RCP”) 4.5 scenario represents an \nintermediate, middle-of-the-road scenario where social, economic and technological \ntrends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Global and national institutions \nwork toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals; \noverall, the intensity resource and energy use declines. The scenario assumes that glob- \nal mean temperature reaches 2.7 °C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nThe NGFS Current Policies (“CP”) scenario represents a low-transition risk scenario \nthat captures the current state of global climate policy. The scenario assumes that  \nno future emissions reduction policies are implemented by governments, leading to high \nphysical risks. In this scenario, 3°C or more of warming could occur by 2100¹.\nSevere  \nScenario\nSevere  \nScenario\nBaseline  \nScenario\nBaseline  \nScenario",

The average \nglobal temperature in 2022 was approximately 1.15° C above \npre-industrial levels (1850 –1900) ¹¹. The Firm defines this as \nthe “current state” of the climate, with assessments of future \nphysical and transition risk based on further warming above \nthis state.\nRisk Management by Risk Type\nJ.P. Morgan SE is using its own and the Firm’s resources to \nbetter understand how physical and transition risks may man-\nifest and their potential impacts on the existing risk types \nJ.P. Morgan SE manages.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in \nthe credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.\nFor Wholesale Credit Risk, the Firm has built a stress frame-\nwork to estimate potential impacts from a range of climate \ntransition pathways on client financials and credit ratings. \nFor clients operating in carbon-intensive sectors (e.g. Oil & \nGas, Automotive Manufacturing, Power Generation, Steel \nand Cement Manufacturing), the Firm estimates the poten-\ntial impact of a climate transition scenario on their credit rat-\ning by projecting detailed cashflows within the context of a \ntransition scenario (see Scenario Analysis and stress testing). \nThis estimation takes into account the client-level Carbon \nAssessment Framework quantitative and qualitative scores, \nwhich assesses a client’s historical emissions reductions, cur-\nrent and forecasted carbon intensity, as well as actions taken \nto advance their decarbonization. Financial impacts from the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy could manifest in a variety \nof ways, including weaker demand for carbon-intensive prod-\nucts, resulting in lower revenue, or higher operating costs for \ncarbon-emitting companies, if a carbon tax is implemented. \nAdditionally, companies may need to increase their capital \nexpenditures through investments that improve resilience to \nthe low-carbon transition (e.g. power companies investing in \nrenewables). To assess the impact of climate transition risk \non sectors with relatively lower carbon intensity, the Firm \nconducts a separate client-specific internal stress analysis ¹². \nThe potential effect on a client’s credit rating is estimated by \nstressing client financials consistent with industry projected \nperformance in the transition scenario, and factoring in the \nadditional costs incurred due to a carbon tax on the compa-\nny’s emissions. The Firm has also developed risk management \ncapabilities including catastrophe modelling to estimate the \npotential impact of severe weather events exacerbated by cli-\nmate change on its Commercial and Residential Real Estate \nportfolios. Damages from floods could cause potential physi-\ncal damage to the underlying properties, leading to expenses \nfor repairs and disruptions in revenue, as well as changes in \noverall property values thus impacting the credit quality of \nthe portfolio.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in \nmarket factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, \nequity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied vola-\ntilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the \nshort and long term. Climate risk drivers may lead to sharp \nvolatility or persistent changes in the prices of commodities \n¹¹ \u0007World Meteorological Organization\n¹² \u0007Climate transition stress analysis for clients in lower carbon sectors is used \nfor internal climate analysis and not used in client decisioning.",

The Firm has established a \nstress framework to quantify the impact of the transition risk \nstress scenarios to vulnerable asset classes, including impacts \nat J.P. Morgan SE level. The Firm has also analyzed a series of \nphysical drivers to estimate the potential impacts of various \nacute and chronic physical risk events to markets exposures, \nincluding impacts at J.P. Morgan SE level.\nCountry Risk\nJ.P. Morgan SE, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be \nexposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, \npolitical or other significant developments, which adversely \naffect the value of the legal entity’s exposures related to a par-\nticular country or set of countries. The negative implications \nfrom climate change may impact a country’s economic, fiscal, \nmonetary or political frameworks in numerous ways, in turn, \nadversely affecting its sovereign credit ratings. Climate risk \nconsiderations are incorporated, as appropriate, into existing \nsovereign ratings and risk management processes. In addi-\ntion, the Firm has developed a score to help explore the poten-\ntial sensitivity of sovereign ratings to climate risks beyond the \nstandard rating horizon or under specific stress scenarios. \nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting \nfrom inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, \nhuman factors or external events impacting the Firm’s pro-\ncesses or systems. The Firm has integrated climate risk driv-\ners into its operational risk framework and associated Firm-\nwide resiliency processes. Increasingly volatile and severe \nweather events, including more severe storms, flooding, heat \nand related impacts, such as drought and wildfires, have the \npotential to impact the likelihood and severity of a variety of \nexisting operational risks. Potential climate driven impacts are \nevaluated through ongoing assessments of operational risks to \nemployees and customers, the Firm’s facilities, property and \nservice providers, and the Firm’s business activities. \nStrategic Risk \nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputa-\ntion associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or \ninadequate response to changes in the operating environment. \nAn example of such a risk could be the failure to attract green \nbusiness opportunities as society shifts towards a low-carbon \neconomy. In response to climate change, and in support of \nour clients transitioning to a lower-carbon economy, J.P. Mor-\ngan SE may make changes to its business strategy, product \nofferings and risk profile (see for example section 2. of the \n“Annex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023” for further \ninformation on the approach to environmental sustainability).\nReputation risk \nReputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may \nnegatively impact perception of the Firm’s and J.P. Mor-\ngan SE’s integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s and \nJ.P. Morgan SE’s competence by various constituents, includ-\ning clients, counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, \nemployees, communities or the broader public. Reputational \nrisk assessment is designed to take into account the commer-\ncial consequences of actions or inactions that may impact cli-\nents, customers, employees, capital providers and other stake-\nholders. In many cases the Firm recognizes that a position it \ntakes will be favored by some and disapproved of by others, \nand where all positions including neutrality can be controver-\nsial.

Making judgments, estimates and assumptions can \ninvolve levels of uncertainty and subjectivity and therefore actual results could differ from the \nreported amounts. The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 5.\nSome of the judgments, estimates and assumptions management makes when preparing the \nCompany’s financial statements involve high levels of subjectivity and assessments about the \nfuture and other sources of uncertainty. Those that may have a material impact on the Company’s \nfinancial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations are described below.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nThe Bank carries a significant portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. \nCertain financial instruments are classified on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one \nor more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them, the measurement of fair \nvalue is more judgmental. \n– \u0007Judgments – In classifying a financial instrument in the valuation hierarchy, judgment is applied \nin determining whether one or more inputs are observable and significant to the fair value \nmeasurement. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. For instruments \nclassified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate \nmodels and level of valuation adjustments. Refer to note 30. for further information.\n– \u0007Estimates – Details on the Bank’s level 3 financial instruments and the sensitivity of their \nvaluation to the effect of applying reasonable possible alternative assumptions in determining \ntheir fair value as well as the difference between the transaction price and the model value, \ncommonly referred to as “day one profit and loss”, not recognized immediately in the income \nstatement are set out in note 30.\nMEASUREMENT OF THE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCE\nAn expected credit loss allowance (“ECL”) is required for financial assets measured at amortized \ncost and fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) as well as for lending-re-\nlated commitments such as loan commitments and financial guarantees. The measurement of \nECL requires the use of complex models and assumptions about future economic conditions \nand credit behaviors. Explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in \nmeasuring ECL is further detailed in note 35., which also sets out key sensitivities of the ECL to \nchanges in these inputs.\nA number of judgments are also required in measuring ECL, such as:\n– \u0007Determining the criteria for identifying when financial instruments have experienced a signi­\nficant increase in credit risk;",

Significant accounting policies\nThe following are the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial \nstatements. These policies have been applied consistently in each of the years presented, unless \nstated otherwise.\n5.1. CONSOLIDATION\nThe sole shareholder of the Company is J.P. Morgan International Finance Limited, Newark/\nDelaware, and its ultimate parent company is JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wilmington/Delaware, \nboth incorporated in the United States of America. The Company is included in the consolidated \nfinancial statements of JPMorgan Chase & Co., which are publicly available.\nAccording to § 290 in relation to § 296 Para. 2 HGB, the Company is not required to prepare \ngroup financial statements.\n5.2. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated in Euro at the \nexchange rate on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items denominated in foreign \ncurrencies are translated in Euro at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. \nAny gains or losses arising on translation are recognized directly in the income statement.\nNon-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are trans-\nlated in Euro at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated \nin Euro at the foreign exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Translation differences \narising from non-monetary items measured at fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n5.3. FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY\nItems included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the \nprimary economic environment in which the entity and the foreign business operations operate \n(the “functional currency”). Euro is considered as the functional currency for all branches and \nused as the presentation currency of the Company.",

Recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities\nThe Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to \nthe contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of securities are \nrecognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Company commits to purchase or \nsell an asset. Certain margins from clients or margins to central counterparties in the Futures \nand Derivatives Clearing business which are related to the clearing of trades (on behalf of the \nclients) at exchanges aren’t recorded on balance sheet, because they aren’t deemed assets or \nliabilities of the Company.\nII. Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost, fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”). \nDerivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The classification is based on both \nthe business model for managing the financial assets and their contractual cash flow characteris-\ntics. Factors considered by the Company in determining the business model for a group of assets \ninclude past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, how the assets’ \nperformance is evaluated and reported to the board of directors, how risks are assessed and \nmanaged, and how senior managers are compensated. This assessment results in a financial asset \nbeing classified in either a “hold to collect”, “hold to collect and sell”, or “other” business model.\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value. They are subsequently mea-\nsured at amortized cost unless they are held for trading, the fair value option is applied, or they are \nderivatives. In all other cases, financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost if they are held under a business model with \nthe objective to collect contractual cash flows (“Hold to Collect”) and they have contractual \nterms under which cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”). In making \nthe SPPI assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent \nwith a basic lending arrangement (i. e., interest includes only consideration for the time value of \nmoney, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic \nlending arrangement). Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that \nare inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss. \nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and balances at central banks, loans \nand advances to banks, certain loans and advances to customers and certain securities purchased \nunder agreements to resell and debtors that are in the Hold to Collect business model.",

However, such financial instruments are used by the Company predominantly in \nconnection with its “client-driven” market-making and/or for hedging certain assets, liabilities, \npositions, cash flows or anticipated transactions (i. e. risk management activities).\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities measured at FVPL at J.P. Morgan SE consist mainly of \ninstruments which are held for trading. These held for trading instruments comprise both debt \nand equity securities, loans held for trading and derivatives.\nIn addition, certain financial assets that are not held for trading are measured at FVPL if they do \nnot meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost or FVOCI for example, if the financial assets \nare managed on a fair value basis or have contractual cash flows that are not SPPI. \nFinancial instruments measured at FVPL are initially recognized at fair value in the balance sheet. \nTransaction costs and any subsequent fair value gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss \nas they arise.

Designation is only possible when the financial \ninstrument is initially recognized and cannot be subsequently reclassified. Financial assets can \nbe designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss only if such designation eliminates \nor significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (accounting mismatch). \nFinancial liabilities can be designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss only if such \ndesignation (a) eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency; \nor (b) applies to a group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both that the Company manages \nand evaluates on a fair value basis; or (c) relates to an instrument that contains an embedded \nderivative unless the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows required \nby the contract or when a similar hybrid instrument is considered that separation of the embed-\nded derivative is prohibited.",

Lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment, and lease liabilities \nare included in other liabilities for leases in the Company’s balance sheet. The ROU asset is initially \nmeasured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease \npayments made at or before the lease commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred \nand estimated costs for dismantling, removing and restoring as stated and required by the leasing \nagreement, less any lease incentives received. The ROU asset is subsequently amortized on a \nstraight-line basis of the earliest of the two periods of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset \nor the lease term. The estimated useful life of the ROU asset is determined on the same basis as \nthose of the property and equipment. In addition, the ROU asset may be reduced by impairment \nlosses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not \npaid at the commencement date, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. \nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using a constant periodic rate of interest. It is \nre-measured when there is a change in leasing rates as a result of a change in a consumer price \nindex or reference rate, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise \nan extension or termination option. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corre-\nsponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU asset, or is recorded in earnings \nif the carrying amount of the ROU asset has been reduced to zero.\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets\nThe Company has elected to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-\nvalue assets and short-term leases of real estate, including equipment, that have a lease term \nof 12 months or less.

FAIR VALUE\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an \norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nFair values are determined by reference to observable market prices where available and reli-\nable. Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are based on quoted market prices or \ndealer price quotations for financial instruments traded in active markets. Where market prices \nare unavailable, fair value is based on valuation models that consider to the largest possible \nextent relevant transaction characteristics. As inputs are used observable or unobservable market \nparameters, including but not limited to yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity prices, \nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments such as CVA (Credit Valuation \nAdjustment) and FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment) may be done to ensure that financial instru-\nments are recorded at fair value.",

When input values do not directly correspond to the actively \ntraded market parameters the model may perform numerical procedures in the pricing such as \ninterpolation.\nThe Company classifies its assets and liabilities measured at fair value according to a hierarchy \nthat has been established under IFRS. The fair value hierarchy is based on the transparency of \ninputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy \ngives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or \nliabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 inputs).\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level \nof input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFurther details on fair value measurements are provided in note 30. to the financial statements.\n5.8. RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED DAY ONE PROFIT AND LOSS\nThe Company enters into transactions where fair value is determined using valuation models \nthat use significant unobservable inputs. Such a financial instrument is initially recognized at the \ntransaction price, although the value obtained from the relevant valuation model may differ. The \ndifference between the transaction price and the model value, commonly referred to as “day one \nprofit and loss”, is not recognized immediately in the income statement.\nThe timing of recognition of the deferred day one profit and loss is determined for each class of \nfinancial asset and liability. It is either amortized over the life of the transaction, deferred until the \ninstrument’s fair value can be determined using market observable inputs, or realized through \nsettlement. The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the \ndeferred day one profit and loss. \n5.9. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\nNon-financial assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. \nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds \nits recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs \nof disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at \nthe lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows. Prior impairments of non-­\nfinancial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.",

They are \npredominantly measured at FVPL (partially classified as held-for-trading and partially managed \nat FVPL) with those held within the treasury portfolio being measured at amortized cost. The \nconsideration for the transaction can be in the form of cash or securities. If the consideration for \nthe purchase or sale of securities is given in cash, the transaction is recorded on the balance sheet \nwithin securities purchased/sold under agreement to resell/repurchase. In a repo transaction, \nthe Bank retains the risks and rewards of the securities sold under repurchase agreement, these \nsecurities are not derecognized from the balance sheet.

A master netting agreement \nis a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that \nagreement to be terminated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the \nnormal course of the business and in the event of a default (e.g. bankruptcy, failure to make a \nrequired payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).\nFurther details on offsetting of financial assets and liabilities are provided in note 31. to the \nfinancial statements.",

      "text": "NOTES\n122\nThe International Accounting Standards Boards issued in May 2023 amendments to IAS 12 \nIncome Taxes that introduced a mandatory temporary exception to recording deferred taxes \nassociated with jurisdictions implementing Pillar Two rules. The Company has applied the manda-\ntory exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities \nrelated to Top-up Taxes associated with Pillar Two. As such, any Top-up Taxes incurred will be \ntreated as a period cost in the period of occurrence. \nJPMSE has branches in 14 different countries. The applicable tax rates in these countries are \nbetween 12.5% and 33.1% and the statutory tax rate is less than 15% in only one country. \nBased on a country-specific analysis, the company expects to qualify for the safe harbor rules in \nthe transitional years in most countries. In those countries where the requirements are potentially \nnot met, the Company does not expect significant Top-up Taxes related to Pillar Two.\n5.16. INVENTORIES\nThe Bank holds inventories which are comprised of commodity positions that are measured at \nfair value less cost to sell. The Bank considers itself to be a commodity broker-trader because it \nbuys and sells commodities on behalf of other parties and on its own account.\n5.17. PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or objective obligation as a \nresult of past events, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle \nthe obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will \nbe confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not \nwholly within the control of the Company, or a present obligation that arises fromspast events but \nis not recognized because either an outflow of economic benefits is not probable or the amount \nof the obligation cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the \nfinancial statements; however, disclosure is made unless the probability of settlement is remote.\n5.18. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe Bank operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for its employees.\nI. Defined contribution scheme\nA defined contribution plan is a retirement plan in which the Bank pays a defined level of contri-\nbutions to a third party. The Bank is not legally or de facto obliged to pay further contributions if \nthe fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits in connection with the \nemployee service in the current and in previous periods. Obligations for contributions to defined \ncontribution pension plans are recognized as an expense and charged to the income statement \non an accrual basis.",

Defined benefit scheme\nFor defined benefit pension plans, the service cost for providing retirement benefits to employees \nduring the year is recognized in the income statement in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee \nBenefits”. The pension-related expenses and income are recorded on the basis of expert opinions. \nThe appraisals are prepared by qualified and independent actuaries. This ensures that the full \ncosts of covering the pension obligations of current and former employees are correctly recorded.\nThe liabilities of the defined benefit systems are valued on an actuarial basis. Assets are valued \nseparately for each plan at their market value, provided that plan assets exist to cover plan liabil-\nities. Any surplus or deficit of scheme assets over liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet \nas an asset (surplus) or liability (deficit). Current service cost and any past service cost, along \nwith the expected rate of return on the plan’s assets, less the release of the discounting of the \nplan’s liabilities, is charged to the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized \nin full in other comprehensive income in the reporting period in which they occur and shown in \nequity in the reporting period in which they occur.\nFurther details on the Bank’s defined benefit scheme are provided in note 20. to the financial \nstatements.\n5.19. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS\nShare-based payment awards may be made to employees of the Bank under the Firm’s incentive \nawards schemes. The fair value of such shares, rights to shares or stock options is measured \nduring the conditional allocation. This value is recorded as compensation expense for the Bank \nover the period of time that the performance criteria are related to along with employer’s social \nsecurity expenses or other payroll taxes. All of the granted awards are equity-settled. The Bank \nestimates the level of forfeitures and applies this forfeiture rate at the granting date.\nAdditionally, the Bank takes into account the conditions that must be met before an employee \nis eligible for equity instruments under the Bank’s incentive programs. Amortization is acceler-\nated for employees who retire so that the premium is recognized in full as an expense when the \npension entitlement takes effect.\n5.20. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated \nimpairment losses. The Bank calculates the depreciation using the straight-line method over the \nestimated useful life of an asset. The buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over a \nuseful life of up to 50 years. Land is not depreciated. For leasehold improvements, the Bank uses \nthe straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility \nor the estimated useful life of the leased asset. For IT equipment and furniture, the useful life is \ndirected by the official depreciation tables of the financial administration. See accounting policy \nin note 5.6. in respect of right-of-use assets and 5.9. on the impairment of non-financial assets.",

Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-\nline basis over the software’s expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing \nbasis. Intangible assets include purchased and self-developed software and are amortized on a \nstraight-line basis with finite useful life. Software applications are amortized up to 3 years. See \naccounting policy in note 5.9. on the impairment of non-financial assets.\n5.22. ADJUSTMENT OF PRIOR YEAR-FIGURES\nThe Bank adjusted retrospectively the treatment of securities borrowed from counterparties \nwhich are part of a prepaid equity forward sale or prepaid equity collar transaction. This led to a \ncorrection of the financial assets held for trading and financial liabilities designated at fair value \nthrough profit or loss on the balance sheet, which decreased by € 1,015 million. \nIn the reporting period it was identified that the presentation of trading assets pledged in note \n34. was understated. As a result, the pledged trading assets balance as of December 31, 2022 \nwas restated by € 282 million from € 10,305 million to € 10,587 million. Furthermore, the Bank \nadjusted retrospectively the fair value of collateral accepted as follows: Collateral permitted \nto be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used was increased by € 1,883 million from \n€ 174,545 million to € 176,429 million and Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used \nwas decreased by € 282 million from € 158,729 million to € 158,447 million. \nFurthermore, the Bank adjusted retrospectively the levelling of specific derivative receivables \namounting to € 3,726 million from Level 2 to Level 1.\nIt was also identified that the maximum exposure to loss for financial assets and liabilities at fair \nvalue through profit and loss in note 36. was overstated. This led to the maximum exposure to \nloss as of December 31, 2022 being restated to € 7,874 million from € 8,258 million.\nIn the reporting period it was decided that the presentation of certain items in the Statement of \nCashflows would be amended. The reclassification led to cash from operating activities being \nreduced by € 6,187 million, cash from investing activities being increased by € 14,681 million \nand cash from financing activities being reduced by € 8,494 million.",

Income taxes\nCurrent and deferred income taxes\nIncome taxes on taxable income (current taxes) are recognized as an expense in the period in \nwhich the income arises.\nCurrent tax claims and liabilities are measured at the amount at which a refund from tax author-\nities or a payment to tax authorities are expected. For the measurement of these amounts, tax \nrates and tax laws are applied, which are in place as of the balance sheet date or will become \napplicable shortly in the countries where the Bank operates and made taxable income. Current \ntax claims and liabilities are only netted if certain requirements are met.\nDeferred taxes are calculated on temporary differences from the difference between the business \nand tax balance sheets. Deferred taxes are valued at the tax rate valid on the balance sheet date \nand the tax laws for the date of the expected realization. If there is a legally enforceable right \nto offset current taxes and the taxes are levied by the same tax authority and are payable by the \nsame taxable entity, deferred taxes are netted. To the extent that the taxes relate to matters that \nwere recognized directly in equity, current and deferred taxes are also recognized in equity.

Pensions\nDEFINED BENEFITS PENSION PLANS\nThe Bank is involved in the following defined benefits plans:\n– \u0007The Flexible Pension Plan (“FPP”) is the principal active plan offered in Germany since January 1, \n2002. The plan is jointly funded by the staff and the Bank and results in instalment payments \nto participants when they reach retirement age. The plan also provides for payments in the \nevent of disability or death. Plan assets are allocated to mutual funds based on decisions made \nby employees about what type of investments they prefer. The pay-outs are largely linked to \nthe performance of the selected funds with a guaranteed minimum interest rate. Employees \nwill only participate in fund performance that is between 70% and 85% above the guaranteed \nminimum interest rate, with a factor called “profit participation” being applied.\n– \u0007The Heritage pension plans consist of five different legacy plans in Germany. The plans have \nbeen closed and have been funded accordingly. The plans also provide for payments in the event \nof disability or death. The plan assets are held in an investment fund that is mainly invested \nin bonds with an investment grade rating.

Each part of the process is subject to rigorous controls, including \ncapital adequacy reporting at daily, weekly and quarterly frequencies to ensure appropriate \noversight in line with the Capital Management Framework.\nEscalation of issues is driven by a framework of specific limits and indicators defined in J.P. Mor-\ngan SE’s Capital Risk Management Framework.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe minimum capital requirements stand at 14.92% as of December 2023, increased by 0.68% \nin comparison to December 2022, primarily driven by increase in Other Systemically Important \nInstitutions (O-SIIs) buffer to 1% in January 2023 (vs 0.75% in 2022) along with an increase \nin Countercyclical buffer (CCyB) rates across various countries during the year 2023. The entity \nmaintained a comfortable capital surplus over the regulatory minimum requirements, internally \nset targets and risk appetite throughout 2023.\nIn addition to the above listed requirements, J.P. Morgan SE requires to hold a further Pillar 2 \ncapital add-on commonly known as the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G) of 2.00% which must be met \nentirely with CET1 capital. Although not legally binding, the ECB expects J.P. Morgan SE to meet \nthe P2G requirements. Failure to meet the P2G requirements does not lead to automatic supervi-\nsory measures such as restrictions of capital distributions or incentive compensation.",

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value\nVALUATION PROCESS\nThe Bank carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair \nvalue is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If listed prices or quotes are \nnot available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that con-\nsider relevant transaction characteristics and use as inputs observable or unobservable market \nparameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity prices, foreign exchange \nrates, and credit curves.\nThe level of accuracy in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the \namount of gain or loss reported for a particular position. The Bank believes its valuation meth-\nods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants. The methods and \nassumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Bank’s businesses \nand portfolios.\nThe respective business area is responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and \nliabilities carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The independent Valuation Control Group \n(“VCG”) is part of the Bank’s Finance function and is responsible for verifying these estimates and \ndetermining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Bank’s positions \nare reported at fair value. VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the business areas by \nleveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available.\nIn determining the fair value of a derivative portfolio, valuation adjustments may be appropriate \nto reflect the credit quality of the counterparty, the credit quality of the Bank, and the funding \nrisk inherent to certain derivatives. The credit and funding risks of the derivative portfolio are \ngenerally mitigated by arrangements provided to the Bank by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., \nand therefore the Bank takes account of these arrangements in estimating the fair value of its \nderivative portfolio.\nThe Bank makes use of the portfolio exception and manages certain portfolios of financial instru-\nments on the basis of net open risk exposure and has elected to estimate the fair value of such \nportfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. \nWhere this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a \nlarger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are \nbased on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net \nopen risk position.",

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent as a change in one unobserv-\nable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Relationships may also exist \nbetween observable and unobservable inputs. Such relationships have not been included in the \ndiscussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse \nrelationship would also generally apply.\nYield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted \ncash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair \nvalue measurement.\nCredit spread – The credit spread is the difference between risky and risk-free returns. The \ncredit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow \ncalculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease of the fair \nvalue measurement.\nPrepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal \nrepayments of a pre-payable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally \ndecline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment cycles, in isolation, would \nresult in a decrease in the fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an \nincrease in the fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.\nConditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the \noutstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. An \nincrease in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss \nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, \nwould result in a decrease of the fair value measurement.\nLoss severity – The loss severity (the contrary is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of \nfuture realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as \nthe net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is \ngenerally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, \nin isolation, would result in a decrease of the fair value measurement.\nUtilization given default (“UGD”) – A number between 0% and 100% that is the estimated frac-\ntion of the current undrawn balance on a revolving credit facility that will be drawn at the time of \nthe default of the borrower. A higher UGD generally results in a decrease in the fair value of the loan.",

      "text": "NOTES\n166\nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two vari-\nables (e.g. how the change in one variable influences the change in the other). Correlation is a \npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks.\nCorrelation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g. interest rate, credit, equity and foreign \nexchange) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, \nan increase in one parameter will result in an increase of the other parameter. When parameters \nare negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease of the other \nparameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease of the fair value \nmeasurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would \ngenerally result in a decrease of the fair value measurement.\nVolatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, param-\neter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes \nin value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity \noptions, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier \nthe instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would \ngenerally result in an increase of the fair value measurement.\nCREDIT AND FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS \nDerivatives are generally valued with models that use observable market parameters. These \nmarket parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty non-performance risk, \nthe Bank’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make \nadjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.\nCVA represents the valuation adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, nec-\nessary to reflect counterparty non-performance risk. The Bank estimates CVA using a scenario \nanalysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Bank’s existing posi-\ntions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and \nestimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors \ndesigned to mitigate the Bank’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. \nThe key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each \ncounterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery \nrates implied by CDS spreads.\nFVA represents the valuation adjustment to reflect the impact of funding. The Bank’s FVA frame-\nwork, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from \nthe Bank’s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated \nmarket funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Bank’s \ncredit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected",

The lease of real \nestate for the main office in Frankfurt am Main relates to office, parking and storage space and \nexpires in August 2028. It contains renewal and partial cancellation options and/or escalation \nclauses providing for increased rental payments based on a price index.\nVehicle leases are attributable to employees as part of their compensation package.

Transfers of financial assets\nIn the course of its normal business activities, the Bank makes transfers of financial assets. \nDepending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in no derecognition at all of the assets \nsubject to the transfer. A summary of the main transactions and the assets and liabilities and the \nfinancial risks arising from these transactions is set out below.\nTRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN A DERECOGNITION\nAssets are transferred under repurchase and securities lending agreements with other banks \nand financial institutions. In such transactions not all the risks and rewards of ownership are \nsubstantially transferred, therefore the assets are not derecognized from the balance sheet. The \nrecipient is generally able to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the \ntransaction. The Company remains exposed to interest and credit risk on these instruments \nwhich it is contractually required to repurchase at a later date. The counterparty’s recourse is \ngenerally limited to the transferred assets. The carrying amount of the securities pledged under \nrepo transactions is in the amount of € 20,812 million (2022: € 10,305 million). Please refer to \nnote 34. in the financial statements.\nFair value of the assets  \nnot derecognized\nFair value of the assets\nCarrying amount of \nthe related liabilities\n€T\n31/12/2023\n31/12/2022\n31/12/2023\n31/12/2022\nFinancial assets at fair value  \nthrough profit and loss\n294,328\n269,063\n245,560\n257,450\nCONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN DERECOGNIZED\nIn some cases, the Company transfers financial assets that it derecognizes entirely even though \nit may have continuing involvement in them. This typically happens when the Company has sold \na financial asset to a Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”) with limited other assets and enters into a \nderivative with the SPE to provide investors with a specified exposure (examples include cred-\nit-linked note vehicles and asset swap vehicles that are established on behalf of investors). The \nCompany is unlikely to repurchase derecognized financial assets.\nThe total notional and the market value of all derivatives executed by the Company with such \nSPEs amounted to € 2,469 million and € 129 million as of 2023 (€ 500 million and € 30 million",

Due to the nature of the derivatives, the maximum exposure to loss is deemed to be \nthe mark to market on those derivatives.\nThe assets transferred are recorded at fair value, and as such there are immaterial gains and \nlosses upon the transfer of assets as the transactions are back-to back with J.P. Morgan Group \nentities. The year to date gains on the client executed derivative trade by the Company amounted \nto € 239 million as of 2023 (€ –0.7 million as of 2022).\n34. Pledged assets and collateral received\nThe Company pledges assets for various purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other \nsecurities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and \ndeposits.

ECL are recognized for financial \nassets that are measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income \n(“FVOCI”) and for specified lending-related commitments, such as loan commitments and financial \nguarantee contracts. The measurement of ECLs must reflect:\na. \u0007An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of \npossible outcomes;\nb. \u0007The time value of money; and\nc. \u0007Reasonable and evidence-based information about past events, current (economic) conditions, \nand forecasts of future economic conditions.\nThe measurement of ECL also reflects how the Bank manages the financial instruments it uses for \ncredit risk purposes such as Traditional Credit Products (“TCP”) and non-traditional credit prod-\nucts (“Non-TCP”). Instruments in scope of TCP include loans, lending-related commitments, and \nother lending products stemming from extensions of credit to borrowers (including intercompany \nand affiliated entities). Non-TCP include, but are not limited to, other third-party and intercom-\npany debt instruments such as reverse repurchase agreements, margin loans, fee receivables, \nand intercompany receivables (such as cash and deposits).\nThe following tables set out the gross carrying amount (before ECL) of the Bank’s financial assets \nthat are measured at amortized cost or FVOCI by the respective TCP and Non-TCP (including debt \nsecurities) categories as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Should further requirements result from \nIFRS 9, these are also considered. For Stage 3 instruments, ECL is calculated considering the \nprobability of default over the remaining life of each instrument (“Lifetime ECL”) on an individual \nasset basis and the interest revenue is calculated on the net carrying amount (that is, net of the \nallowance for credit losses). All financial assets, regardless of their category as TCP, Non-TCP, or \ndebt security, are considered to be credit-impaired and included in Stage 3 when one or more \nof the following events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that \nfinancial asset has occurred:",

However, for assets that were considered to be Stage 3 as a result \nof a restructuring where the borrower experiencing financial difficulty was granted a financial \nconcession, there is no cure period and the asset will remain in Stage 3.\nSignificant increase in credit risk (Stage 2)\nFinancial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (“SICR”) since \ninitial recognition for which there is no objective evidence of impairment are included in Stage \n2.

The credit facility has been downgraded;\nb. The obligor grade risk has significantly deteriorated;\nc. The facility is 90 days past due not credit impaired;\nd. The facility has been restructured due to credit reasons but does not qualify as Stage 3.\nThe Bank’s TCP portfolio is mostly comprised of large, international, wholesale borrowers. For \nthese borrowers, short-term delinquencies alone are not considered to be a meaningful credit \nquality indicator as the Bank’s experience has shown that other internal credit quality indica-\ntors generally identify increases in credit risk well before delinquency. As such, the Bank has \ndetermined that using the quantitative and qualitative assessments described above are most \nappropriate for capturing SICR for TCP. \nThe approach for determining whether there has been a SICR for Non-TCP portfolios depends on \nthe type of instrument. The Bank assumes as Non-TCP financial assets that are 30 days past due, \nhave experienced a SICR and are included in Stage 2. Inter-company loans and receivables to \nmaterial legal entities covered by the resolution and recovery plans are assumed not to have had \na SICR given the borrower’s level of capitalization and access to liquidity. Finally, the remainder \nof the Bank’s Non-TCP is mostly short-term and generally no SICR has arisen prior to the maturity \nof that instrument. Financial instruments that are in Stage 2 are moved to Stage 1 as described \nbelow in the period that the quantitative and qualitative assessments for a SICR no longer exist.\nWithout significant increase in credit risk (Stage 1)\nFinancial instruments that have not experienced a SICR since initial recognition for which there \nis no objective evidence of impairment are included in Stage 1.

Changes in economic conditions or in the Bank’s assumptions and judgments \ncould affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.\nThe Bank considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. \nIt is difficult to estimate how alternative judgments in specific factors might affect the overall \nallowance for credit losses due to the idiosyncratic nature of the factors and inputs involved.",

In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors \ncreate further uncertainties.\nThere have not been any significant changes in estimation techniques or assumptions made \nduring the 2023 reporting period.\nManagement adjustments\nA working group which consists of J.P. Morgan SE Credit Risk Management, J.P. Morgan SE \nCredit Risk Controlling and the IFRS 9 Reporting Team is responsible for the local review and \nmonitoring of the model-based results of the ECL-results. Additionally the working group assesses \non the appropriateness of the used scenarios including the forecasted macroeconomic variables \nthat are used for the calculation of the ECL. Management adjustments are prepared for potential \nmaterial risks that are not reflected in the model and are provided to the J.P. Morgan SE CRO \nand CFO for their approval.\nThere have not been any significant changes in estimation techniques or assumptions made \nduring the 2023 reporting period except for the continued Local management adjustment in sce-\nnario weights adopted during 2022 (where adverse weighting was applied on rising interest rates \nleading to inflation and likelihood of moderate recession). Impact of scenario weight adjustment \nis € 22.0 million for year end 2023.\nStage 3 portfolio estimation techniques\nIn estimating ECL for Stage 3 loans using an individual discounted cash flow assessment, broad \neconomic conditions affecting a borrower are less relevant as they may not have a direct impact \non the specific borrower and his ability to service their debts. Consequently, the Bank believes \nthat borrower specific scenarios are the most relevant in estimating expected credit losses in \nan individual discounted cash flow assessment. When applying the discounted cash flow meth-\nodology, the Bank projects cash flows under three borrower-specific forecast scenarios that are \nreviewed, adjusted and ultimately blended into one probability-weighted calculation of ECL.\nECL measurement for Non-TCP portfolios\nThe Bank’s approach to measuring ECL for Non-TCP portfolios depends on the type of instrument.",

Cash and balances at central banks \nCash and balances with central banks include interest-bearing deposits and are held with invest-\nment-grade institutions.\nIn evaluating the lifetime ECL related to receivables from a bank, the Bank determined the \nexpected probability of default was extremely remote, and the magnitude of lifetime ECL related \nto exposures would be negligible as these are regulated investment-grade institutions that have \nsignificant capital, loss absorbing capacity and liquidity. The majority of the deposits held are \nshort-term in nature and can be withdrawn at short notice (typically overnight).\nb. Deposits with banks \nThe Bank places substantially all of its deposits with banks which are of investment-grade. Refer \nto section a. above for ECL assessment. Similar to cash and balances at central banks, the Bank \nincludes loans and advances to banks in Stage 1 as investment-grade institutions that are con-\nsidered to have high quality credit with low risk of default and therefore the Bank has concluded \nthere is no material SICR.\nc. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed\nThe Bank generally bears credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed where \ncash advanced to the counterparty exceeds the expected value of the collateral received on \ndefault. The Bank’s credit exposure on these transactions is significantly lower than the amounts \nrecognized on balance sheet as the substantial majority represents contractual value before \nconsideration of any collateral received.\nWhere a fully collateralized arrangement exists (for example a reverse repurchase agreement), the \nestimate of the allowance is immaterial € 0.8 million for 2023 due to the following credit mitigants:\n– \u0007Continuous margining requirements: The contractual terms of these agreements are designed \nto ensure that they are fully collateralized based on continuous margining requirements, even \nwhen the credit risk of the borrower increases significantly. The contractual terms provide the \nBank (as lender) with the legal right to receive additional margin from the borrower each day \na margin deficit exists. The contractual terms also allow the Bank to increase margin require-\nments, and to revoke or reduce (lending) commitments to the borrower at any time.\n– \u0007Intercompany arrangements may be repayable on demand: The vast majority of the Bank’s \ncollateralized intercompany lending arrangements are executed under master contracts that \nprovide additional protections for the Firm, such as stipulating that extensions of credit are \nrepayable on demand.\n– \u0007High quality collateral: If, in the extremely rare circumstance that the borrower were to default, \nbecause the collateral is generally of high quality (G5 government obligations) or is otherwise \nconsidered highly liquid, the Bank has the legal right and operational ability, as well as the",

The fair \nvalue of the security collateral in respect of securities financing transactions is, in aggregate, \ngreater than the net amounts reported on balance sheet.\nSecurities financing arrangements tend to be short-term in nature with no history of credit losses. \nThese arrangements are included in Stage 1 as the Bank has determined there is no SICR during \nthe short tenor of the instrument as at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\nd. Debtors\nDebtors consist of trade and other debtors. Trade debtors mainly consist of unsettled trades, \nreceivables related to sales of securities which have not yet settled. \nThese receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of default of a \nclearing organization default and failure to deliver, and the short-term nature of receivables \nrelated to securities settlements which are predominately on a delivery versus payment basis. \nThe Bank recognizes no ECL on these balances as the ECL related to these exposures is assessed \nas immaterial.\nOther debtors primarily comprise receivables related to cash collateral paid to counterparties \nin respect of derivative financial instruments. Margin posted in cash is reflected as a receivable \nfrom the counterparty and is carried at amortized cost. Furthermore, the Bank provides clearing \nservices to its clients wherein it facilitates the execution and settlement of derivative transactions \nby intermediating between a Central Clearing Party (“CCP”) and a client, the associated cash \ncollateral is recognized at amortized cost. \nIn evaluating the lifetime ECL related to receivables from a CCP, the Bank determined the expected \nprobability of CCP default was extremely remote, and the magnitude of lifetime expected credit losses \nrelated to CCP exposures would be negligible due to the multi-layered credit protection inherent in the \ndesign and operations of the CCP clearing model. The Bank includes these receivables in Stage 1 due \nto the multi-layered credit protection inherent in the design and operations of the CCP clearing model.\ne.

Unfunded capped default fund commitments to CCP \nJ.P. Morgan SE is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses \nthrough which it provides clearing services. Membership in these CCPs requires the Firm to pay \na pro-rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another \nmember. \nFor some CCPs, the Firm can now estimate maximum possible exposure under these membership \nagreements (based on the CCP’s rulebooks), which are reported as “Other commitments“ as an \noff balance sheet item. As at December 31, 2023, the commitment amounted to € 2.398 million \n(2022: € 1.771 million). \nThese unfunded capped default fund commitments, which represent the maximum potential loss, \nrelate to a commitment to provide funds to clearing houses and central counterparties (CCPs) \nin the event of default by a member of those counterparties. When a member defaults, the loss \nincurred by the counterparties is allocated on a pro-rata basis among the other non-defaulting \nmembers, where the amount of loss is allocated based on the volume of activity between the \nnon-defaulting member and the defaulting member. \nh. Other assets \nThe accounting policy for other assets requires they be written off when the asset is (i) deemed \nto be uncollectible or (ii) past due for more than 90 days, whichever occurs first.\nThe Bank believes that the 90-day write-off policy materially limits the Non-TCP exposure recog-\nnized on the balance sheet for Non-TCP that may have collectability concerns and no additional \nimpairment charges are required for Non-TCP in this category.\nThe Bank relies on the staging backstops in IFRS 9 and presumes that other assets that are 30 \ndpd have experienced a SICR and are included in Stage 2.

      "text": "197\nNOTES\nChanges in the notional amount of loan commitments and financial guarantees contributed to \nchanges to the ECL in the reporting period 2023 as follows:\n– \u0007A positive balance of new loan commitments and financial guarantees increased the gross \nbook value of the loan commitments and financial guarantees. Overall decrease in ECL is driven \nmainly from improved macro economic variables.\n2. Non-traditional credit products (Non-TCPs)\nNon-TCPs include all other instruments measured at amortized cost and are subject to the impair-\nment provisions according to “IFRS 9”. The Bank hasn’t recorded any ECL for Non-TCPs, because \nthe ECL on these instruments is considered as immaterial.\nThe approach for measuring ECL for Non-TCP portfolios follows the type of instrument. An analysis \nby balance sheet item can be found above in the section “ECL measurement for Non-TCP portfolios”.\nCREDIT RISK EXPOSURES\nThe following tables include an analysis of credit risk exposure for all financial assets irrespective \nof whether an ECL has been recorded for them or not. An ECL is recorded for a financial instrument \nif it is subject to the IFRS 9 impairment rules.\nMaximum credit risk exposure\nThe gross balance sheet exposure represents the Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk from \nthese assets. It is determined separately for each counterparty for derivatives and securities, \ntaking into account enforceable netting agreements in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial Instru-\nments: Presentation” for which there is legal right and the intention of a net settlement. The \nnet exposure after risk mitigation is presented taking into account for assets that are primarily \nexposed to market risk, the aforementioned enforceable master netting agreements (where the \nnetting criteria according to IAS 32 are not met) and the value of the collateral received. Cash \nand securities collateral is taken into account at their respective fair values, while other collateral \nreceived, such as guarantees and sureties, is generally not taken into account.\nThe collateral is taken into account under conditions that are customary for the relevant secu-\nrities and financing transactions. J.P. Morgan SE receives securities as collateral for securities \nrepurchase agreements or cash-backed securities lending transactions. These can generally be \nresold or repledged by J.P. Morgan SE. For the resale or repledging of the collateral provided, \nthe customary contractual terms apply. The quality of the collateral is assured by its ability to be \nliquidated, used and third party usability, as well as by regular evaluation.\nThe Bank’s credit risks are described in more detail below. Since the ECL is only recognized \non loans and advances held at amortized cost and FVOCI, further analyses of the Bank’s credit \ncommitments are included.",

Interest in unconsolidated structured entities\nSTRUCTURED ENTITIES\nThe Company engages in various business activities with structured entities which are designed \nto achieve a specific business purpose. A structured entity is an entity that has been designed \nso that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, \nsuch as, when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are \ndirected by means of other contractual arrangements.\nTypically, structured entities have one or more of the following characteristics:\n– \u0007An insufficient amount of at-risk equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without \nadditional subordinated financial support;\n– \u0007Equity at-risk owners that, as a group, are not able to make significant decisions relating to the \nentity’s activities through voting rights or similar rights; or\n– \u0007Equity at-risk owners that do not absorb the entity’s losses or receive the entity’s residual \nreturns.\nThe most common type of structured entity is a special purpose entity (“SPE”). SPEs are commonly \nused in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows \nfrom those assets to investors. The party that has power to direct the most significant activities \nof the entity and an exposure to the risks of the entity (together constituting control of the entity) \nis required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the structured entity.\nThe Company has involvement with various structured entities, established by the Firm or by \nthird parties. These typically include securitizations, credit linked notes (“CLN”) and asset swap \nvehicles.\n– \u0007Securitizations – Residential and commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-based entities: \nthe Company invests in securities generally issued by third party sponsored structured entities. \nThe Company is not able to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s activities through \nvoting rights or similar rights.\n– \u0007CLN and asset swap vehicles – the Company’s involvement with CLN and asset swap vehicles \nis generally limited to being a derivative counterparty. The Company does not provide any \nadditional contractual financial support to the structured entities over and above its contractual \nobligations as derivative counterparty, but may also make a market in the notes issued by such \nstructured entities, although it is under no obligation to do so. As a derivative counterparty the \nassets held by the structured entities serve as collateral for any derivatives receivables.\nThe Company considers a “Firm-sponsored” SPE to include any entity where: (1) J.P. Morgan SE \nis the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the SPE is used by J.P. Morgan SE to securitize",

J.P. Morgan SE does \nnot use Firm-sponsored SPEs for any of the cases mentioned above.\nINTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\nThe Company’s interest in an unconsolidated structured entity is considered as the contractual \nand non-contractual involvement that exposes the Company to the variability of returns from the \nperformance of the structured entity, but not deemed a subsidiary.\nThe following table shows, by type of structured entity, the carrying amounts of the Company’s \ninterest in unconsolidated structured entities recognized on the balance sheet. The maximum \nexposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated \nstructured entity. The maximum exposure for loans and securities is reflected by their carrying \namounts of these interests. The maximum exposure for off balance sheet commitments such \nas guarantees, liquidity facilities and loan commitments is reflected by the notional amounts of \npotential future losses. The derivative types reflected in the table consist primarily of plain vanilla \ninstruments such as interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and FX forwards. The maximum \nexposure for asset swap vehicles and credit-related notes is determined based on the amount \nof collateral.\nThe table also provides an indication of the size of the structured entities, measured by the total \nassets held in the structured entity. The carrying amounts do not necessarily reflect the risks \nfaced by the Company, as factors such as economic hedges and effect of collateral held by the \nCompany are not included.",

Market risk\nINTERBANK OFFERED RATE (ªIBORº) TRANSITION\nThe Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) \nhave observed that the secular decline in interbank short-term funding poses structural risks for \nunsecured benchmark interest rates such as Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”), and therefore \nregulators and market participants in various jurisdictions identified alternative reference rates \nthat are compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commission’s standards for \ntransaction-based benchmarks.\nThe publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i. e., overnight, one-month, \nthree-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023 (“LIBOR Cessation”). The \none-month, three-month and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be published \non a “synthetic” basis, which will allow market participants to use such rates for certain legacy \nLIBOR-linked contracts through September 30, 2024. \nAs part of the Bank’s overall transition efforts which culminated in the second quarter of 2023, \nthe Bank successfully completed the conversion of predominantly all of its remaining cleared \nderivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)\nas part of initiatives by the principal central counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives \nprior to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Bank’s other U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products that \nremained outstanding at LIBOR Cessation have been remediated through contractual fallback \nprovisions or through the framework provided by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR \nAct”). The Bank expects the limited contracts remaining that reference “synthetic” U.S. dollar \nLIBOR will be remediated by September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank continues to track cessation of other (non-LIBOR) IBORs and will continue to remediate \noutstanding contracts proactively ahead of cessation or through contractual fallback provisions. \nExposure to other IBORs across the Bank is limited with remediation overseen by impacted busi-\nnesses within the relevant jurisdictions. Given the non-material exposures the Bank has to other \nIBORs, quantitative reporting of exposures will cease in 2024.\nOn August 27, 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) issued guidance \nthat provides practical expedients to contracts and hedge accounting relationships affected by \nthe reference rate reform. These practical expedients are intended to simplify the operational \nimpact of applying existing IFRS requirements to transactions impacted by the reference rate \nreform, and the Bank applied the practical expedients from January 1, 2021. \nThe table below shows the outstanding principal amounts of non-derivative financial instruments, the \ngross notional values of derivative financial instruments and the contractual amounts of off-balance \nsheet exposures held by the Bank as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively,",

Morgan Group entities amounted to € 0.5 million \nfor the year 2023 (2022: release of impairment of € 29.2 million). The impairment on financial \ninstruments reported in 2022 was mainly driven by the release of provisions for credit losses \namounting to € 29.5 million due to the significant reduction of internal reverse repurchase agree-\nments with J.P. Morgan Group entities as a result of the J.P. Morgan SE merger. The amount of \ncredit loss allowances on the Balance Sheet amounted to € 1.0 million as of December 31, 2023 \n(31/12/2022: € 0.6 million).\nTransactions with J.P. Morgan Group entities are mainly related to liquidity management, covering \nfunding requirements, risk management activities (e.g. when risk is managed centrally in the \ngroup) or related to J.P. Morgan SE being the group’s point of contact to the European Central \nBank, acting as the Euro-Clearer of the group and to provide access to continental-European \nexchanges to facilitate clearing activities of client trades. Related to these activities, there are \nregularly back-to-back trades with J.P. Morgan Group entities as well. Transactions with J.P. \nMorgan Group entities are performed on arm’s length principle.\nJ.P. Morgan SE has issued a guarantee for notes, warrants and certificates issued by J.P. Morgan \nStructured Products B.V. (JPMSPBV) that are held by third parties in the maximum nominal \namount of $ 5 billion (31/12/2022: $ 5 billion). In the event of non-performance on payments due \non the securities issued by JPMSPBV, J.P. Morgan SE has the obligation to perform payments to \nholders of the securities. Thereby, the fair value of the securities – and hence the payments due – \ncan exceed the maximum nominal value. For the guarantee, J.P. Morgan SE does not receive a \nseparate compensation. Providing the guarantee is however to be viewed in the overall context \nof enlarging the business activities as part of the implementation of the J.P. Morgan group-wide \nBrexit strategy.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value of issued securities amounted to € 2,377 million \n(31/12/2022: € 1,284 million), of which J.P. Morgan SE held € 2,199 million (31/12/2022: \n€ 1,194 million), leading to a guaranteed amount of € 177.7 million as of the reporting date \n(31/12/2022: € 90.2 million). Unused guarantee amounted to € 2,148 million as of December \n31, 2023, (€ 3,403 million as of 31/12/2022) and it has been considered in the calculation of \nthe expected credit loss.\nFor this guarantee, a credit loss provision of € 0.1 million was set up as of the reporting date \n(31/12/2022: € 0.2 million), which is already included in the total provided above for J.P. Morgan \ngroup entities.\nIn 2023, JPMCB NA transferred certain business activities of its Paris Branch to JPMSE Paris \nBranch.

Our responsibility under those \nprovisions and standards is described in the Section “AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE \nAUDIT OF THE IFRS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE MANAGEMENT REPORT”. We \nare independent of the company in accordance with European law and German commercial and \nprofessional law and we have fulfilled our other German professional obligations in accordance \nwith these requirements. \nIn addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) letter (f) of the EU-APrVO we declare that we have \nnot performed any prohibited non-audit services as defined in Article 5 (1) of the EU-APrVO. \nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \nfor our audit opinion on the IFRS separate financial statements and on the management report.\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE IFRS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance \nin our audit of the IFRS separate financial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2023 \nto December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the IFRS \nseparate financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide \na separate audit opinion on these matters.\nWe have identified the following matter as a key audit matter:\nValuation of financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation models\nFacts of the matter\nAs of December 31, 2023, J.P. Morgan SE has trading assets of € 210,237 million and trading \nliabilities of € 182,292 million. The valuation result is included in the net result of assets and \nliabilities measured at fair value. This amounts to € 1,509 million for the financial year from \nJanuary 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. \nTransactions in the trading portfolio are initially measured at cost. In accordance with IFRS 13, \nsubsequent measurement is at fair value. If there is no active market for financial instruments \nheld for trading on the basis of which the market price can be determined, J.P. Morgan SE uses \nrecognized valuation methods (procedures and models) to determine the fair value. For certain \nfinancial instruments, parameters that are not observable in an active market are included in the \nvaluation. The parameters are based on estimated values or internal key figures. This relates in \nparticular to complex derivatives and debt securities. \nThe selection of the valuation models and their parameterization are subject to discretionary \ndecisions. As the subsequent measurement of financial instruments held for trading is highly \ndependent on assumptions and judgments due to the complexity of the valuation techniques \nIndependent Audit Report",

Morgan SE’s disclosures on the valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value using \nvaluation models are included in the notes to the IFRS separate financial statements, in particular \nin Section “5.7. Fair Value” and Section “30. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value.”\nAudit response and findings\nWe first obtained a comprehensive insight into the development of the financial instruments \nheld for trading, the associated risks and the internal control system in relation to the valuation \nof the financial instruments held for trading. For the assessment of the adequacy of the internal \ncontrol system with regard to the valuation of financial instruments including valuation models, \nwe inspected relevant organizational guidelines, internal reporting and other documents as well \nas conducted interviews and identified relevant controls.\nWe assessed the adequacy and effectiveness of the relevant specific controls. In particular, we \nassessed the controls for independent price verification, for independent model validation and \nassessment of model limitations, for monitoring the use of valuation models, and for calculating \nvaluation adjustments. \nIn a sample of financial instruments to be measured at fair value involving valuation models, we \nperformed our own independent valuation using our own models and input parameters.\nWe performed our audit procedures on the valuation models and on our own independent reval-\nuation with the involvement of our internal specialists with expertise in the valuation of financial \ninstruments.\nBased on our audit procedures, we are satisfied that the valuation models used by the Manage-\nment Board to determine the fair values of the financial instruments held for trading for which \nthere is no active market are appropriate and in accordance with the applicable valuation prin-\nciples.

(also “JPMorgan Chase”, the “Firm”, or “JPM Group”) communicates \ninformation about its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policies and performance \nthrough a number of channels. JPMorgan Chase maintains a dedicated ESG Information page on \nits website to facilitate access to information on these topics. ¹\nTo complement the Firm’s information, J.P. Morgan SE (also “JPMSE”, the “Bank”, the “entity”, \n“we” or “our”) is publishing its third Separate Non-Financial Report on a legal entity level, as an \nannex to its Annual Report 2023. J.P. Morgan SE publishes this Separate Non-Financial Report \nin accordance with §§ 289b – 289e of the German Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch” or \n“HGB”) and thus complies with the requirements of European Union Directive 2014/95/EU ² and \nthe German “CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz”. Given that J.P. Morgan SE is fully integrated \ninto the Firm’s governance framework including ESG, we decided not to rely on a national or \ninternational framework for this particular report, but to adopt a tailored structure which allows \nus to comprehensively reference where the Bank relies on the Firm’s principles, objectives and \nefforts to drive our ESG agenda.\nThe consideration of ESG aspects across all levels of the banking business and the implementation \nof ESG-related regulatory and supervisory requirements are a key focus area for the Bank. Our ESG \ndisclosures will further develop over future iterations to address evolving regulatory expectations \n(e.g. the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) and stakeholder information needs.\n1.2. OUR BUSINESS PRINCIPLES AND BUSINESS MODEL\nAs one of the oldest financial institutions in the United States – and one of the largest in the world – \nJPMorgan Chase seeks to build a thriving business and to support a sustainable and inclusive \neconomy. The Firm firmly believes that continued success is rooted in steadfast adherence to \nits Business Principles, which are centered around strengthening, safeguarding and growing its \ncompany over the long term. JPMorgan Chase’s Purpose – Make dreams possible for everyone, \neverywhere, every day – knits together the Firm’s values with its everyday business principles, \nand explains how JPM Group has done business for years.\nThe Firm’s and the Bank’s approach to ESG is supported and strengthened by ongoing efforts \nto enhance accountability, transparency and engagement. Additionally, we strive to leverage \nthe Firm’s governance structures to foster sound management and a culture of accountability \non ESG matters. This includes defining oversight and management of ESG matters within and \nacross our lines of business. \nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)\nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (Unaudited)\n¹ \u0007https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/esg\n² \u0007Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 22, 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU \nas regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups",

Morgan SE is fully integrated into the corporate culture of JPMorgan Chase whose guiding \nprinciples are described by the four pillars of the group-wide Business Principles, outlined below \nand in section 2.1. of the Management Report. These principles apply consistently across lines \nof business and geographies where JPMorgan Chase and the Bank operate.\nJ.P. Morgan SE is a core part of JPM Group’s long-term European commitment and represents a \nstrategic legal entity which continues to:\n– \u0007Deliver a cross-line of business (“LOB”) platform with significant scale and capability;\n– \u0007Maintain an adequate capital base to support business strategic growth and a fortress balance \nsheet;\n– \u0007Strive for simplification and efficiencies facilitating visibility and generating opportunities for \noptimization; and\n– \u0007Support and help clients with a well-diversified product offering.\nIn 2023, alongside the strong business performance across all segments, the key focus of the \nManagement Board was on the further strengthening of its governance model across the 15 \ncountries in the European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK, the integration of environmental \nand climate risk considerations into our business model, the further strengthening of our capital \nbase, the completion of the business transfer from JPMCB Paris to JPMSE Paris, the dialogue with \nour clients, and our day-to-day operations. Another area of focus remained our people agenda, \nin light of more than 12% headcount growth from 4,526 at the end of 2022 to 5,071 at the end \nof 2023 and the subsequent integration of new joiners into the Firm culture of “How We Do \nBusiness” ³. These areas of focus stand on the pillar of our four business principles:\n– \u0007Exceptional Client Service\n– \u0007Operational Excellence\n– \u0007A Commitment to Integrity, Fairness and Responsibility\n– \u0007A Great Team and Winning Culture\nRespect is at the core of our culture.

SCALING GREEN SOLUTIONS\nMobilizing Capital to Support Climate and Sustainable Solutions\nDeveloping solutions to advance the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy will require \nsignificant capital, including capital to deploy and scale clean energy solutions to meet the world’s \ngrowing energy needs and capital to promote sustainable management of resources such as \nwater and forests.\nThe Firm’s $1 trillion Green target – which was set in April 2021 as part of the broader $2.5 tril-\nlion Sustainable Development Target – intends to support the development and scaling of climate \ninitiatives and sustainable resource management.\nJPMorgan Chase also supports the market through its own Green Bond issuances. For more details \non JPMorgan Chase Green Bond issuance, see the JPM Group ESG Report Appendices.\nSupporting the Firm’s clients\nHighlighted below are the continued efforts JPMorgan Chase makes to support the climate- and \nsustainability-related banking needs of its clients, from early stage and small companies through \nto multinationals and other large corporations. \nThe Firm deploys its capital and expertise to assist clients working to transition their business \nmodel and operations to reduce emissions. As JPMorgan Chase expands its capabilities across \nits LOBs, it aims to provide clients with diverse and innovative solutions, while helping to grow \nthe market for green and sustainable financing.\nSupporting Green Technology: Europe’s Largest Ever Green Loan\nIn Europe’s largest ever green loan, JPMSE has co-led a $5 billion debt deal for a Swedish bat-\ntery maker, a key supplier to the auto manufacturing sector. This comes amid booming investor \nappetite for green debt and the trend for multinational companies to build components closer \nto home. Equally, it supports JPMorgan Chase’s goal of financing and facilitating $1 trillion of \ngreen initiatives by 2030. \nThe Swedish battery maker, Europe’s only large homegrown electric battery maker, is renowned \nfor its cutting-edge battery technology and green credentials. In November, the company \nannounced a design for a new sodium-ion battery, which could help to reduce the region’s reli-\nance on raw materials sourced from China, including lithium, nickel and graphite. It is believed \nto be the first battery made completely free from these critical raw materials.\nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)",

BALANCING ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC NEEDS\nAchieving long-term, inclusive and sustainable economic growth globally requires balancing \nenvironmental needs, societal advancement and economic stability. While the world needs to work \nswiftly toward environmental goals such as achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050, it needs \nto do so in a way that supports the world’s growing energy demand to power societal progress \nand fosters equitable energy access, reliability, security and affordability.\nFor JPMorgan Chase, recognizing the balance needed to achieve long-term sustainability informs \nthe Firm’s approach to environmental initiatives. JPMorgan Chase’s initiatives are rooted in \nhow the Firm does business: this means serving its customers, clients and communities while \nrunning a healthy and vibrant company. Examples of this work include using the Firm’s capital \nand expertise to support clients in advancing their low-carbon transition goals, and in turn, \nadvancing progress toward its own net zero-aligned targets; deploying its philanthropic capital \nto support initiatives that help communities globally advance their resilience to climate change; \nand evaluating and managing potential risks – such as E&S and climate risks – within JPMorgan \nChase as well as JPMSE.\nAddressing the Firm’s Financed and Facilitated Emissions\nA key aspect of the Firm’s environmental sustainability strategy is how JPMorgan Chase engages \nwith its clients who operate in carbon intensive industries, with a goal of helping them facilitate \ntheir low-carbon transition and encouraging near-term actions that will set a path for global net \nzero emissions by 2050. In support of the Firm’s strategy, JPMorgan Chase is working to align \nkey sectors of its financing portfolio with net zero emissions by 2050. To date, JPMorgan Chase \nhas set net zero-aligned targets for eight sectors: Oil & Gas, Electric Power, Auto Manufacturing, \nIron & Steel, Cement, Aviation, Shipping and Aluminum. The Firm’s 2023 Climate Report provides \nadditional information on the Firm’s net zero-aligned targets, including new targets, updates to \nexisting targets and progress the Firm has made toward these as of December 31, 2022. The \nFirm’s Carbon Compass® methodology provides details on the Firm’s approach to setting its net \nzero-aligned targets, including key sectoral considerations, decarbonization pathways, and data \nand metrics used.\nThe Firm’s Carbon Assessment Framework\nAs the Firm continues to expand its sector-specific net zero-aligned targets, the Firm is also \nfocused on aligning its capabilities and efforts to make progress toward them. The Firm strives \nto use its knowledge and expertise to help clients think through and act on their decarbonization \nplans, while also aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of key sectors in the Firm’s financing \nportfolio.\nThe Firm’s Carbon Assessment Framework (“CAF”) adds a climate lens to the way the Firm makes \nfinancing decisions. It aims to provide a consistent, comprehensive, and data-driven approach to \nassess its clients’ emissions and decarbonization plans.

MINIMIZING OPERATIONAL IMPACT\nThe Firm and J.P. Morgan SE strive to minimize the environmental impact of their own opera-\ntions – including their real estate and supply chain. The Firm’s reported operational environmental \nfootprint is driven primarily by the energy and resources the Firm uses to run its global network \nof more than 6,000 corporate offices, bank branches and data centers, as well as regular activities \nsuch as business travel. The Firm’s approach to minimizing operational impact centers on man-\naging its energy and carbon footprint, constructing and operating more sustainable buildings, \nand implementing leading practices in sustainable sourcing and resource management.\nEnergy and Carbon Footprint Management\nThe Firm’s strategy for energy and carbon footprint management is guided by its carbon-related \noperational targets, including reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 40% \nby 2030 vs. a 2017 baseline and sourcing renewable electricity for 100% of its global power \nneeds annually. These targets are not specifically disaggregated at the Bank’s level; rather, they \nare established at a Firmwide level. More information on the Firm’s operational sustainability \ntargets is published on its website ⁶.\nJPMorgan Chase’s Operational GHG Emissions Footprint\nIn 2023, the largest drivers of the Firm’s operational GHG emissions ⁷ were the energy it uses for \nits buildings (e.g., electricity, heating and cooling) as well as business travel. The key categories \nof emissions included: \n– \u0007Scope 1. Direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in buildings and company-owned \naircraft and vehicles (i. e. natural gas, jet fuel, gasoline).\n– \u0007Scope 2. Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, which accounts for the largest share \nof its overall footprint.\n– \u0007Scope 3 – Category 6 Business Travel.

The mission of the GoGreen teams is to increase employee awareness of \nsustainability initiatives at JPMorgan Chase – including its operational sustainability targets, and \nwhat the Firm is doing to meet them – as well as offer employees opportunities to learn about \nand engage in sustainable activities at work, at home and in their communities. \nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)\n⁸ \u0007https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/sustainability/es-initiatives#operational-targets",

Morgan SE’s 2023 Employee Engagement Initiatives\nRecognizing the important role the Bank’s employees can play in addressing sustainability chal-\nlenges and climate change, as of January 2023, a new benefit for Germany-based employees was \nintroduced which provides the opportunity to lease company bikes and e-bikes. This encourages \nemployees to not only stay active, but to foster a more climate-friendly commute to work. As of \nApril 2024, 58 job bikes were ordered by our employees.\nIn the Bank’s major office locations, efforts are ongoing to eliminate or reduce use of single-use \nplastics, improve waste segregation and recycling in the office, and promote employee awareness \nand action on environmental sustainability. As a part of the JPMorgan Chase global tree planting \nprogramme, a tree is planted for each new entrant who joins J.P. Morgan SE or its branches.\nGoGreen employee-led chapters are active in the majority of countries where J.P. Morgan SE has \na presence with more than 1,900 members who follow the mission to drive positive environmental \nchange in the communities where they live and work. In this spirit, employees have organized \na variety of events and initiatives during 2023, ranging from litter picking and/or green area \nclean up volunteer events in Frankfurt and Warsaw, a tree planting employee volunteer event in \nLuxembourg, the set-up of new wildlife beds for bees and other insects in parks nearby Glasgow, \na green fair on the Firm’s premises in Paris showcasing sustainable products to encourage \nemployees make more mindful consumption choices, a vegan cooking class in Dublin, as well \nas book swaps, eco runs and speaker series events across the Bank’s locations. GoGreen teams \nacross J.P. Morgan SE also participated in the Firm’s global events and initiatives to mark the \nUnited Nations (UN) Earth Day, World Water Day, World Environment Day and others.\n2.4. CLIMATE RISK\nClimate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of climate change on the Firm’s and the Bank’s \nclients, customers, operations and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk \nthat may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm and JPMSE. Detailed information on \nclimate risk, including governance, can be found in section 6.6.3. of the Risk Report.\n2.5. DISCLOSURE ACCORDING TO ART. 8 OF THE EU TAXONOMY\nThe European Union has passed Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and associated delegated acts (the \n“Taxonomy Regulation”) as part of its framework to facilitate sustainable investment.\nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)",

      "text": "248\nThe Taxonomy Regulation is part of the European Commission’s “European Green Deal.” The \nCommission is seeking to help the EU reach climate neutrality by 2050, make its society more \nresilient to the impacts of climate change, enhance the efficient use of resources through a clean \nand circular economy, restore biodiversity, and prevent pollution. The Taxonomy Regulation aims \nto scale up and accelerate financial flows towards economic activities that are environmentally \nsustainable. It is closely linked to a number of other EU policies related to non-financial disclosure. \nIt complements the Non-Financial Reporting directive or Corporate Sustainability Reporting Direc-\ntive under which companies have or will have a mandatory obligation to disclose how some of their \nactivities align with criteria set out in the Taxonomy Regulation. The Taxonomy Regulation also \ninteracts with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation which requires certain financial \nproducts with specified environmental objectives and characteristics to disclose the proportion \nof their underlying investments that are aligned with the Taxonomy Regulation. The Taxonomy \nRegulation also facilitates the development of European standards for environmentally sustainable \nproducts, such as the European Green Bond Standard which makes use of the Taxonomy Reg-\nulation to determine what expenditure should be considered to be environmentally sustainable. \nThe Taxonomy Regulation requires J.P. Morgan SE to publish information on how and to what \nextent the Bank’s activities are associated with economic activities that are classified as envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Environmentally sustainable activities aligned with the Taxonomy are \neconomic activities that contribute substantially to climate change mitigation and adaptation \nobjectives and activities which contribute substantially to the sustainable use and protection of \nwater and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and \ncontrol, or to the protection and the restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. \nThis disclosure is produced to meet those requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation that specify \nthe content, methodology, and presentation of information to be disclosed by J.P. Morgan SE that \nis required to produce Non-Financial disclosures which set out the extent to which the activities \nit carries out meet the criteria set out in the Taxonomy Regulation. The Taxonomy Regulation \nrecognizes that activities are aligned when they make a substantial (and not a marginal) con-\ntribution to reaching at least one of the EU’s environmental objectives set out in the Taxonomy \nRegulation as well as doing no significant harm to the other environment objectives, meets min-\nimum social safeguards and satisfies technical screening criteria which are also provided for in \nthe Taxonomy regulation. \nJ.P. Morgan SE is disclosing EU Taxonomy information as a Financial Undertaking under the Tax-\nonomy Regulation and leverages the “General Templates” and the “Nuclear and Gas Templates” \nrequired by the Taxonomy Regulation (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 and Delegated \nRegulation (EU) 2022/1214). This disclosure sets out how and to what extent JPMSE has used \nthe Taxonomy Regulation to determine the classification of its financial activity that is Taxono-\nmy-aligned expressed as the percentage of its overall in-scope financial activity. The regulation \nrefers to the calculation and disclosure performed by firms as the GAR or “Green Asset Ratio.”\nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)",

      "text": "249\nTaxonomy Regulation disclosure templates for Nuclear & Gas covering “loans and advances not \nheld for trading” require the Bank to provide information about economic activities in the fossil \ngas and nuclear sectors. \nMarket practice and understanding of the application and interpretation of certain terms under \nthe EU Taxonomy has not yet settled as the legislation continues to evolve and further regula-\ntory clarifications are released. As market practice develops and further regulatory guidance is \nprovided around this, and as the EU Taxonomy is developed further, the Bank’s disclosures may \nchange. In particular, in December 2023 the European Commission produced an extensive set \nof frequently asked questions covering a number of matters concerning the interpretation and \nimplementation of the Taxonomy Regulation. J.P. Morgan SE has sought to apply the guidance \nbut notes that the material is not yet final and may remain subject to change as the industry and \nregulatory authorities continue to engage to enhance the common understanding and application \nof the Taxonomy Regulation.\nWhere there is no published data relevant to our counterparties (including clients) at the time of \nthe finalization of these accounts, J.P. Morgan SE is not representing taxonomy information in \nrelation to these counterparties. After the Bank publishes this report, further counterparty disclo-\nsures for year-end 2023 may be made in the course of 2024. Our year-end 2023 report reflects \nthe availability of data as of the time of finalizing this report and as reported by NFRD entities. \nThe Weighted Average Green Asset Ratio (GAR) is less than 1% which is mainly driven by the \nsignificant proportion of trading revenues, fees and commissions, and interest earned by central \nbank deposits in the Bank’s revenues.\nFor further context, a significant proportion of the Bank’s covered assets is composed of “other \nassets, other demand deposits, tangible assets and tax assets” that are not considered EU Tax-\nonomy eligible. Additionally, as a significant percentage of our clients are not EU public entities \nand private entities, we may or may not see EU Taxonomy disclosures for those. \nThe financial guarantees offered by J.P. Morgan SE are mostly related to agency security financing \nor facing non-NFRD entities. \nJPMSE residential mortgage loans have not been assessed for alignment in accordance with the \nClimate Delegated Act Annex I “7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings,” due to the avail-\nability of data for those. The total eligible residential mortgage loans remain represented in the \ndenominator and eligible fields of the reporting template.\nIn preparing the required templates, “0” means zero or a fraction of a percentage or absolute \nnumber rounded down to zero and “–“ means that there is no reportable information.\nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)",

These groups serve as networks for employees to connect with colleagues and grow \nprofessionally, while advancing the Firm’s DEI strategies. Recognizing the intersectionality of \nthe different groups represented by the BRGs, the Firm is taking steps to promote and facilitate \ncross-BRG collaboration.

Morgan SE, has established Global DEI Centers \nof Excellence (“COEs”) to take a coordinated and intersectional approach to identifying and pro-\nviding equitable pathways to opportunities for employees, customers and communities to grow \nand thrive. For example, the Women on the Move (WOTM) Center of Excellence seeks to help \ncreate a more equitable workforce that enables women to achieve financial well-being, grow their \nskills and advance their careers.

The Firm’s compensation philosophy includes guiding princi-\nples that drive compensation-related decisions across the Firm. We believe in an equitable and \nwell-governed approach to compensation that includes pay-for-performance practices designed \nto attract and retain the best talent, is responsive to and aligned with shareholders’ interests, \nreinforces the Firm’s culture and Business Principles, and integrates risk, controls and conduct \nconsiderations. We conduct compensation review processes for all employees, seeking to evaluate \nthe equity and competitiveness of their pay.\nAs outlined in the Firm’s Equal Opportunity, Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy, \nJPMorgan Chase, including J.P. Morgan SE, is also committed to providing equal opportunity in \naccordance with applicable local law in all areas of people management, including recruitment, \nemployment, assignment, transfer, promotion, compensation, benefits and training. JPMSE’s \nremuneration policies and practices are consistent with this commitment and do not discriminate \non the basis of gender or any other personal characteristic protected under applicable local law \nor the Firm’s Code of Conduct.\nPay Equity \nThe Firm is committed to fair compensation for its employees and conducts periodic pay equity \nreviews that include employees at all levels within the Firm, including J.P.

At JPMor-\ngan Chase, in 2023, taking into account factors such as an employee’s role, tenure, seniority \nand geography, in aggregate, globally, those who self-identified as women were paid 99% of \nwhat men were paid.\nPay equity reviews give the Firm important insights, but they are just a starting point. If we identify \nindividuals with compensation that is less than expected, we dig deeper. Where appropriate, the \nFirm takes action to address it. While we are proud of the overall diversity of our workforce, we \nrecognize that there is lower representation among women and ethnically diverse employees, \nparticularly in senior management level positions. We are taking a variety of actions focused on \nmore broadly sourcing, recruiting, developing and advancing the full breadth of available talent, \nincluding women and ethnically diverse talent. \nWell-Being and Work Life Balance\nThe Firm, including J.P. Morgan SE, wants to help enable its employees to lead satisfying and \nfulfilling lives both in and out of work. That is why the Firm, including the Bank, offers compre-\nhensive health and wellness benefits to its employees and their families and continuously explores \nways to strengthen benefit offerings. Among the health and wellness benefits included in the Firm \nand the Bank’s 2023 offerings for employees, which vary depending on location, were healthcare \ncoverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, access to on-site health and wellness \nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)",

Morgan SE has flexible work options to support parents and others, and we \nprovide additional flexible unpaid leave options and other assistance to working parents.\nThe Firm’s Parents@jpmc program, which includes the Bank’s locations, offers educational ses-\nsions with parenting experts and connects parents with a wide range of other programs offered \nby the Firm. For those with young children, the Firm tries to remove some of the stress associated \nwith finding and paying for child care by offering access to comprehensive child care support. \nThis includes access to on-site and near-site child care centers for full-service and back-up care \nneeds in many large locations. Through this program, the Firm offers support to employees caring \nfor elderly parents – they can access elder care referrals and management, and health advocacy \nservices to navigate insurance and medical issues. \n3.2.

We acknowledge that our business has the potential to impact surrounding commu-\nnities and the environment; as such, it is important that we consider human rights issues when \nmaking business decisions.

The Standards set out the roles and responsibilities for the lines of business \nand other stakeholders across the firm, making it clear that prompt submission is important to \nensure timely payment, within the standard payment timeframe.\nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)\n¹⁰ \u0007https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/jpmc-commitment-to-anti- \ncorruption-compliance.pdf",

Morgan SE continues to assess the evolving scope of the reporting obligations, including con-\nsideration of core definitions within the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) \nand accompanying standards. Confirmation of this scope will result in more accurate information \nfor this metric, to be included in future disclosures by the Bank, along with relevant contextual \ninformation.\nStandard payment terms\nAll supplier contracts have net 60-day terms or shorter. Standard payment terms applicable to \nall categories of suppliers are 2% 10 business days; net 60. This means that J.P. Morgan SE will \nreceive a 2% discount if the invoice is paid within 10 business days of receipt. If the invoice is \nnot paid within 10 days with the discount taken, it will be paid within 60 days. \nAnnex: Separate Non-Financial Report 2023 (unaudited)\n¹¹ \u0007https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/suppliers/guidelines-documents",
