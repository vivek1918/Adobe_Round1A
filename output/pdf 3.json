      "text": "Dear Fellow Shareholders,\nJamie Dimon,  \nChairman and  \nChief Executive Officer\nAcross the globe, 2024 was yet another year of significant challenges, from  \nthe terrible ongoing war and violence in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East \nto ongoing terrorist activity and growing geopolitical tensions, importantly with \nChina. Our hearts go out to those whose lives are profoundly affected by these \nevents. \nJPMorganChase, a company that historically has worked across borders and \nboundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure, \nbut it is not immune to the effects of these events. Two things are absolutely \nfoundational to the long-term success of JPMorganChase: one is whether  \nwe run a great company and two, which is maybe more important, is whether \nthe long-term health of America, domestically, and the future of the free and \ndemocratic world are strong. In the first two sections of this letter, I deal with \nthese critical issues. And in the third and fourth sections, I talk about specific \nissues unique to JPMorganChase and how we are addressing them, including \nconstantly fighting complacency, arrogance and bureaucracy. \n2\nINTRODUCTION",

      "text": "1\t Represents managed \nrevenue.\n2\t Adjusted ROTCE of  \n20% excludes $5.4 billion \nfrom net income in 2024  \nas a result of the net gain  \nrelated to Visa shares  \nand the donation of  \nVisa shares to pre-fund \ncontributions to the  \nFirm’s Foundation.  \nThis is a non-GAAP  \nfinancial measure.\nDespite the unsettling landscape, the U.S. economy, at least until recently, \ncontinued to be resilient, with consumers still spending (though with some \nrecent weakening) and businesses still healthy. It is important to note that the \neconomy has been fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and \npast stimulus. There also remains a growing need for increased expenditure on \ninfrastructure, the restructuring of global supply chains and the military, which \nmay lead to stickier inflation and ultimately higher rates than markets currently \nexpect. The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to \nconsider a greater probability of a recession. And even with the recent decline  \nin market values, prices remain relatively high. These significant and somewhat \nunprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious. There is much more \ndetail on all of this in section three.\n2024 was another strong year for JPMorganChase, with our firm generating \nrecord revenue for the seventh consecutive year, as well as setting numerous \nrecords in each of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2024 of  \n$180.6 billion1 and net income of $58.5 billion, with return on tangible common \nequity (ROTCE) of 20%2, reflecting strong underlying performance across our \nbusinesses. We also increased our quarterly common dividend of $1.05 per \nshare to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 – and again to $1.25 per \nshare in the third quarter of 2024 – while continuing to reinforce our fortress \nbalance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and contin-\nued to make significant investments in products, people and technology while \nexercising strict risk disciplines. \nThroughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy \nand guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients – as we \nalways are – in both good times and bad times. The result was continued  \nbroad healthy growth across the firm. The charts on pages 6–12 show our \nperformance results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we \ncompare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. \nPlease peruse them and the CEO and COO letters in this Annual Report, all of \nwhich provide specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future.\nIn 2024, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing  \neconomic growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling  \n$2.8 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world.  \n3\nINTRODUCTION",

      "text": "On a daily basis, we move over $10 trillion in 120+ currencies and more than 160 \ncountries, as well as safeguard over $35 trillion in assets. After we purchased \nand effectively fully integrated First Republic Bank, that bank failure disappeared \nas a negative issue for the U.S. economy. In addition to bringing much-needed \nstability to the U.S. banking system, we were able to give a new, secure home to \napproximately half a million First Republic customers.\nWhile we have modified our approach to certain corporate responsibilities  \nto conform to new guidance, we remain committed to reaching out to all \ncommunities in an effort to create a stronger, more inclusive economy – from \nsupporting work skills training programs around the world and financing \naffordable housing and small businesses to making investments in our people \nand in cities like Detroit that show how business and government leaders can \nwork together to solve problems. Almost all of these efforts are commercial in \nnature; i.e., “profit seeking” and are no different from what businesses, large and \nsmall, are trying to do in towns across America.\nWe have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key \nprinciples and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5), which \nallow us to drive good organic growth and promote proper management of our \ncapital (including dividends and stock buybacks). \nI remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of \nthousands of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and \nindividually. Throughout these recent challenging years, we have never  \nstopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our \ncommunities. As you know, we are champions of banking’s essential role in a \ncommunity – its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies \nand individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in \ndifficult times. I often remind our employees that the work we do matters and \nhas impact. United by our principles and purpose, we help people and \ninstitutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, \nhomeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities \nand countries in all regions of the world. What we have accomplished in the  \n20+ years since the JPMorganChase and Bank One merger is evidence of the \nimportance of our values.\n4\nINTRODUCTION",

      "text": "Steadfast Principles Worth Repeating \nLooking back on the past two+ \ndecades – starting from my time as \nChairman and CEO of Bank One in 2000 \n– there is one common theme: our \nunwavering dedication to help clients, \ncommunities and countries throughout \nthe world. Clearly our financial disci-\npline, constant investment in innova-\ntion and ongoing development of our \npeople have enabled us to achieve this \nconsistency and commitment. In addi-\ntion, across the firm, we uphold certain \nsteadfast tenets that are worth \nrepeating. \nFirst, our work has very real human \nimpact. While JPMorganChase stock is \nowned by large institutions, pension \nplans, mutual funds and directly by  \nsingle investors, the ultimate beneficia-\nries, in almost all cases, are individuals \nin our communities. More than 100  \nmillion people in the United States own \nstocks; many, in one way or another, \nown JPMorganChase stock. Frequently, \nthese shareholders are veterans, teach-\ners, police officers, firefighters, health-\ncare workers, retirees, or those saving \nfor a home, education or retirement. \nOften, our employees also bank these \nshareholders, as well as their families \nand their companies. Your management \nteam goes to work every day recogniz-\ning the enormous responsibility that we \nhave to all of our shareholders. \nSecond, shareholder value can be built \nonly if you maintain a healthy and \nvibrant company, which means doing a \ngood job of taking care of your custom-\ners, employees and communities.  \nConversely, how can you have a healthy \ncompany if you neglect any of these \nstakeholders? As we have learned over \nthe past few years, there are myriad \nways an institution can demonstrate its \ncompassion for its employees and its \ncommunities while still strengthening \nshareholder value.\nThird, while we don’t run the company \nworrying about the stock price in the \nshort run, in the long run we consider \nour stock price a measure of our prog-\nress over time. This progress is a func-\ntion of continual investments in our \npeople, systems and products, in good \nand bad times, to build our capabilities. \nThese important investments will also \ndrive our company’s future prospects \nand position it to grow and prosper for \ndecades. Measured by stock perfor-\nmance, our progress is exceptional. For \nexample, whether looking back 10 years \nor even further to 2004, when the \nJPMorganChase/Bank One merger \ntook place, we have outperformed the \nStandard & Poor’s 500 Index and the \nStandard & Poor’s Financials Index. \nFourth, we are united behind basic prin-\nciples and strategies (you can see the \nprinciples for How We Do Business on \nour website and our Purpose statement \nin my letter from 2022) that have helped \nbuild this company and made it thrive. \nThese allow us to maintain a fortress \nbalance sheet, constantly invest and \nnurture talent, fully satisfy regulators, \ncontinually improve risk, governance \nand controls, and serve customers and \nclients while lifting up communities \nworldwide. This philosophy is embed-\nded in our company culture and influ-\nences nearly every role in the firm. \nFifth, we strive to build enduring busi-\nnesses, which rely on and benefit from \none another, but we are not a conglom-\nerate. This structure helps generate our \nsuperior returns. Nonetheless, despite \nour best efforts, the walls that protect \nthis company are not particularly high \n– and we face extraordinary competi-\ntion. I have written about this reality \nextensively in the past and cover it \nagain in this letter. We recognize our \nstrengths and vulnerabilities, and we \nplay our hand as best we can.\nSixth, we must be a source of strength, \nparticularly in tough times, for our  \nclients and the countries in which we \noperate. We must take seriously our \nrole as one of the guardians of the \nworld’s financial systems.\nSeventh, we operate with a very import-\nant silent partner – the U.S. government \n– noting, as my friend Warren Buffett \npoints out, that his company’s success \nis predicated upon the extraordinary \nconditions our country creates. He is \nright to say to his shareholders that \nwhen they see the American flag, they \nall should say thank you. We should, \ntoo. JPMorganChase is a healthy and \nthriving company, and we always want \nto give back and pay our fair share. We \ndo pay our fair share – and we want it to \nbe spent well and have the greatest \nimpact. To give you an idea of where our \ntaxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, \nwe paid more than $52 billion in federal, \nstate and local taxes in the United \nStates and over $26 billion in taxes out-\nside of the United States. Additionally, \nwe paid the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation over $11 billion so that it \nhas the resources to cover failures in \nthe American banking sector. Our  \npartner – the federal government – also \nimposes significant regulations upon \nus, and it is imperative that we meet all \nlegal and regulatory requirements \nimposed on our company. \nEighth and finally, we know the founda-\ntion of our success rests with our  \npeople. They are the front line, both \nindividually and as teams, serving our \ncustomers and communities, building \nthe technology, making the strategic \ndecisions, managing the risks, deter-\nmining our investments and driving \ninnovation. However you view the world \n– its complexity, risks and opportunities \n– a company’s prosperity requires a \ngreat team of people with guts, brains, \nintegrity, enormous capabilities and \nhigh standards of professional excel-\nlence to ensure its ongoing success.\n5",

      "text": "I. America and the World \nAre at a Critical Crossroads: \nComprehensive Action and \nLeadership Are Imperative Now\nOnly America Has the Economic, Military and, Yes, Moral Power\nI am writing about this topic, both as a patriot \nwho cares about America’s and the free world’s \nfuture and as the CEO of our company, because \nit may be the most critical factor affecting the \nfuture of JPMorganChase itself. The success of \nJPMorganChase has always been predicated on \nthe success of the United States of America and \nthe health of the world, particularly the strength \nof free and democratic countries. \nWhether you call them adversaries or major \ncompetitors, they have made their goal clear. \nWe must act now.\nThe brutal invasion of Ukraine and the inde-\nscribable terrorist acts on Israel should have dis-\npelled any illusion that the world is a safe place. \nWe do not need another Pearl Harbor or 9/11 to \nshatter any false sense of security based on the \nhopeful notion that dictators, terrorists and \noppressive nations won’t use their economic \nand military powers to advance their aims –  \nparticularly against what they perceive as weak, \nincompetent and disorganized Western democ-\nracies. Global peace and world order are vital \nAmerican interests. We also need to answer the \nquestion: What kind of world do we want to live \nin? And do we believe that we can, or should, try \nto make the world a better place? Practically, \nwhat is the other choice? \nOur international adversaries and major com-\npetitors have made it clear that their goal is to \ndismantle American hegemony, which means \ndismantling the rules-based system led by \nAmerica in concert with our allies (essentially \nthe Bretton Woods system and the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, as well as the International \nMonetary Fund and the United Nations). Since \nthe end of World War II, this system has brought \nforth the longest period of peace and prosperity \namong the great powers. Today, it is clear this \nsystem needs serious reform and strengthen-\ning, not total destruction. Yet, if given the oppor-\ntunity, that is exactly what our adversaries want \nto happen: Tear asunder the extensive military \nand economic alliances that America and its \nallies have forged. In the multipolar world that \nfollows, it will be every nation for itself – giving \nour adversaries the opportunity to set the rules \nand use military and economic coercion to get \nwhat they want. That is what is at stake here. We \nneed to bring the whole of government and the \nprivate sector together to build the world we \nwant while dealing with the cold realities of the \nworld we have. \nWe face the most perilous and complicated geo-\npolitical and economic environment since World \nWar II. Today’s world is more complex and more \ninterconnected than ever before. Comprehen-\nsive strategies, diligently deployed, are required \nto address challenges on many fronts: the war  \nin Ukraine; terrorism in the Middle East and the \nreal possibility that Iran may develop a nuclear \nweapon; Europe’s potential fragmentation; and \nongoing trade disputes and the rise of China.  \nIf Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, many other \nnations around the world will seek to acquire \nnuclear weapons, presenting us with a cata-\nstrophic situation. A global nuclear arms race  \nis the worst outcome that could happen to our \nworld – and this may be the greatest threat to \nmankind’s survival. Lastly, it is extremely \nimportant to recognize that security and  \neconomics are interconnected – “economic” \nwarfare has caused military warfare in the past.\nNot only is America’s global leadership role \nbeing challenged outside our borders by other \nnations but also inside our borders by our  \npolarized electorate. \n15\n15\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

      "text": "The actions taken in the next decade may prove, \ndepending on how our country and our allies per-\nform, the most consequential of our lives and may \nvery well determine the fate of the free and demo-\ncratic world over the next century. America has \nalways had an amazing ability to confront enor-\nmous challenges – and we did so by facing them \nhead-on with superb leadership from Abraham \nLincoln to FDR to Dwight Eisenhower. We should \nremember that America, “conceived in liberty \nand dedicated to the proposition that all men are \ncreated equal,” still remains a shining beacon of \nhope to citizens around the world. \nHere are five things our nation needs to do well \nin order to secure the future we should want for \nour country and our companies. I fear that if we \nfail at one of them, we may fail overall: \n1.\t\nCelebrate America’s values and virtues,  \nwith humility, in order to restore civic pride, \ncitizenship and purpose. \n2.\t Acknowledge and fix our problems at home \nby regaining common sense and being \nresolute. \n3.\t Recognize that the best strategy for  \nAmerica’s success is to implement effective \ndomestic policies that drive robust economic \ngrowth for the benefit of all citizens. \n4.\t Initiate comprehensive economic foreign \npolicy to win the new global “economic” war. \nAmerica will be first – but not if it is alone.\n5.\t Affirm that our national security and the \nworld’s best military, at whatever cost, are \nparamount and necessary for peace.\nThese are my prescriptions, and I understand \nthat some people may disagree with them – and, \non some issues, I may ultimately be wrong. What \nI am not wrong about, however, is the urgent \nneed to face these issues head-on – we should \nnot assume that America will overcome them. \nWe have always been a resilient nation and have \novercome significant adversity in the past \nbecause we faced our challenges and dealt with \nthem properly. Problems don’t age well. And the \nconsequences of not dealing with this properly \nrange from bad to catastrophic.\nCELEBRATE AMERICA’S VALUES AND \nVIRTUES, WITH HUMILITY, IN ORDER TO \nRESTORE CIVIC PRIDE, CITIZENSHIP \nAND PURPOSE. \nTo be able to attack our problems at home  \nand abroad, we must be strong. And our core \nstrength is based upon our commitment to our \nvalues, as well as our ability to work hard and \nthink intelligently about our problems. If the soul \nof America is not strong, then the rest will be \nweak. While we should acknowledge America’s \nflaws, they should not be used to pull apart our \ncountry.\nOur values transcend any political stance –  \nlibertarian, conservative, progressive, Democrat \nor Republican. We need to believe in ourselves \nand get back to work (in the office!), not tear \neach other down. \nAmerica’s strength is not a divine right – it is \nearned by citizens committed to a common \npurpose.\nMany of the blind ideologies being bandied \nabout run counter to our fundamental principles. \nOur principles of freedom of speech, religion \nand enterprise allow individuals to pursue life as \nthey lawfully see fit. Ideologues often adhere to \nrigid beliefs and seek to impose those beliefs on \nothers; in extreme forms of fanaticism, there is \nno room for individual differences. \nI applaud many traditional Democratic values, \nsuch as a commitment to try to lift up all of our \ncitizens and to provide more justice and equal \nopportunity. I also deeply respect many tradi-\ntional Republican values, such as a dedication  \nto provide a strong national defense, to promote \nfree enterprise and encourage a pro-business \nenvironment, and to emphasize the importance \nof the Constitution. And we should all support \nother core values, such as family, country, \nself-reliance, respect for workers and common \nsense. These values are not mutually exclusive \nand should be embraced and upheld by both \nparties. We, the people, need to be able to \nembody all these values. \nEven with all of our current problems, billions of \npeople, if they could, would leave their country \nand move to ours. Similarly, if most people could \nonly invest in one country, they would choose \nthe United States. Our exceptionalism is based \n16\n16\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

      "text": "on our freedoms, our liberties, our opportunities \nand our rule of law, all under the protection of \nthe Constitution (and the military) of the United \nStates of America. You need only to witness the \ndeep appreciation of new citizens, who often \nmade enormous sacrifices to be here, to feel \nwhat it must be like when they take the Oath of \nAllegiance to the United States of America – it \nwould bring you to tears. \nIt is incumbent on us to educate ourselves, our \nfellow citizens and future generations about \nAmerican values and our ongoing pursuit of a \nmore perfect democracy. This education should \nstart in grammar school – our civic roles and \nresponsibilities need to be taught. Our common \nvalues are transcendent. \nACKNOWLEDGE AND FIX OUR \nPROBLEMS AT HOME BY REGAINING \nCOMMON SENSE AND BEING \nRESOLUTE.\nFacts are often used by people to justify what \nthey already think, and then populists on both \nsides distort the facts and use them to jazz up citi-\nzens around their grievances. But, as former U.K. \nPrime Minister Tony Blair asserts, we need to sep-\narate the populists from the grievances because \nmany of these grievances are partially rooted in \ntruth and must be addressed. The following are \nissues that I believe are causing legitimate frustra-\ntion and anger in the country today. This list is not \ncomplete, but let’s acknowledge some of these \nprofound challenges. In this section and the next,  \nI discuss some possible solutions: \n•\t Lack of control of our borders. Uncontrolled \nimmigration is highly disturbing to affected \npopulations around the world and reduces the \nability to manage legal and needed immigra-\ntion. In the United States, the number of immi-\ngrants has increased by approximately 50% \nover the last 20 years. Once we gain control of \nour borders, I believe most Americans would \nsupport increasing merit-based immigration, \nincluding allowing anyone who earns a degree \nhere to stay, ensuring there are proper visas \nfor seasonal workers, enabling children born \nin this country to remain and providing a rigor-\nous path to citizenship for law-abiding, undoc-\numented immigrants. Healthy and proper \nimmigration would bring great talent to our \ncountry and has been shown to actually help \ngrow the economy.\n•\t Too many left behind. Our fellow citizens at \nthe lowest income tier have, in fact, been left \nbehind, a trend we’re seeing globally. From \n1979 to 2019, wage growth of the top 10% \nincome tier was nearly 10 times that of the \nbottom 10% – which, basically, did not \nincrease at all. Our very low-income citizens \nexperience higher school dropout rates, \ngreater joblessness, increased drug use and \ncrime in their neighborhoods, and signifi-\ncantly worse health outcomes. They often \nreside in rural areas and in inner cities. So \nwhile enormous wealth has been created in \nthe country, the promise of equal opportunity \nseems unfulfilled for too many for too long. \n•\t Education, some of the best and some of the \nworst. We have many of the best universities \n(including research universities) in the world. \nHowever, over the last 20 years, the cost of \ncollege has more than doubled for both public \nand private colleges, while household median \nincomes have gone up only 18%. Many inner-\ncity schools graduate under 50% of their stu-\ndents. And in both high schools and colleges, \nwe don’t teach enough skills that lead to \nwell-paying jobs. Again, this affects the bot-\ntom income tier far more. Equal opportunity is \nclearly not fairly shared. \n•\t Ineffective and incompetent government. \nMost people do not believe that the govern-\nment, regardless of party control, is doing a \ngood job. For some, it’s the constant bureau-\ncracy, lack of permitting and failing schools; \nfor others, it’s the constant anti-business  \nsentiment. We struggle to build pipelines, \nupgrade our electrical grid, develop high-\nspeed rails and accomplish other necessary \ngoals. Our government seems unable to \nreform and reorganize itself, which is a prob-\nlem. This is amplified by the fact that many of \nour career politicians have little real-world \nexperience, and it shows. We have failed  \nat basic common sense. And let’s stipulate \nhere that this is not about blaming individual \nworkers. We all know that many government \nemployees are hard-working, ethical and  \ncaring citizens doing very important jobs that \nsupport and protect their fellow Americans. \n17\n17\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

      "text": "•\t Profligate fiscal management. Most people \ndo not believe that giving the government \nmore money leads to better outcomes. In fact, \nmost people perceive government actions, \nsuch as special tax breaks, as patronage for \nfavored interest groups. Many people think \nthe tax system itself is littered with unfair \nloopholes. Government has been fiscally irre-\nsponsible and profligate – and even with all \nthe money spent, grievances increased. Our \ngovernment estimates that it makes over \n$200 billion in “improper” payments per year. \nSomehow, we have huge deficits and bad \noutcomes.\n•\t A leviathan both too weak and too strong. \nOur state is paradoxically both too weak – \nineffective at accomplishing essential tasks – \nand overly strong – overreaching in ways that \nundermine fundamental democratic princi-\nples like individual freedom and autonomy. \nOver the last few decades, many have felt  \nviolated by the government’s increasing inter-\nventions. This heavy-handedness often  \nprescribes not only how we should act but \nalso how we should think and feel. \n•\t Culture wars and virtue signaling. In the past, \nthe elite often insulted traditional values of \nfamily, God and individual success, lecturing \nabout their superior values from their com-\nfortable perches and imposing all of this on \npeople who believed differently. We have \nimplemented many climate policies that do \nnot effectively address climate change and \nraise the cost of living. We have stopped \nteaching some important parts of American \nhistory. Instead of acknowledging America’s \nsignificant virtues, we denigrate them and \ntear them down. We engage too frequently in \nclass warfare and excessively in identity poli-\ntics; i.e., using race, sex or creed inappropri-\nately. And state laws were passed that actually \nincrease crime instead of preventing it. Many \nof these policies hurt the very people they \nwere meant to protect most. Many cities that \npaid a high price for their misguided policies \nare now returning to obvious policy goals – \nsafe streets, better schools, more housing. \nUnfortunately, more and more people are \nbeing disrespectful, condescending and \nunwilling to listen to one another. While \nadjustments are needed, it is quite predict-\nable that the pendulum will swing too far in the \nother direction. When all is said and done, let’s \nhope we can all treat each other with a little \nmore respect. \n•\t An imperfect healthcare system. While in \nsome ways our healthcare is the best in the \nworld, it is also expensive, essentially costing \nalmost twice as much as the average health-\ncare in OECD (Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development) countries. \nOur healthcare system is also lacking in  \npreventive care, transparency and proper \nincentives, and leaves too many uninsured. \n•\t Crippling litigation, bureaucracy and regula-\ntion. An effective legal environment, upheld \nby a dependable judiciary, is essential for eco-\nnomic health, protecting rights, ensuring jus-\ntice, resolving disputes, maintaining checks \nand balances, and supporting innovation.  \nHowever, the current environment is demoral-\nizing and slowing growth. While we all want \njustice through the legal system, our litigation \nsystem is expensive (far more than most other \ncountries), capricious, arbitrary and slow. All \nof this leads to extreme risk aversion – mostly \non the part of government but often on the \npart of business as well. It is concerning that \nsome politicians have grown increasingly \nbeholden to the interests of tort lawyers,  \nposing real risk to balanced policymaking.  \nIn some ways, this could be America’s  \nAchilles heel. \n•\t Red tape 2.0. Red tape has always meant \nexcessive paperwork, bureaucracy and  \nregulations. But it’s been taken to a whole new \nlevel by people who really like it and want even \nmore of it. They have doubled down on regula-\ntions and bureaucracy, which also dramati-\ncally increased red tape. In so doing, they \nmade sure that new rules were written by  \nacademics with no pragmatic experience, \nguaranteeing that they would be excessive, \nconfusing, contradictory and infused with  \nideology. So we need to give credit where \ncredit is due. Therefore, I have renamed it \n“BLUE” tape. Even when “blue” tape has been \nshown to slow down economic growth and \nmake it hard for businesses and individuals to \nthrive, those who created it excuse the out-\ncome and refuse to change (see Europe). \n18\n18\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

      "text": "•\t Damaging trade practices, particularly with \nChina. While trade has greatly benefited the \nworld and many – if not most – American  \ncitizens, the damage that was done to some, \nwhile acknowledged, was never rectified. \nThose who suffered felt the sting – both in lost \njobs and lower wages. We also allowed too \nmuch unfair trade. Finally, and most import-\nant, we failed to protect our national security, \nbecoming too reliant on potential adversaries \nfor critical products that the military needs \n(more on this later). \n•\t Selfishness on the part of our citizens and \nelected officials. Whether it is unions fighting \nnew technologies or businesses getting tax \nbreaks, the focus on “what am I going to get” \nneeds to stop. There are 13,000 groups lobby-\ning in Washington, D.C., defending their “spe-\ncial interest.” Rarely do they fight for what is \ngood for America. When America’s future \nhangs in the balance or when special interest \ngroups wield undue influence, it is time to pri-\noritize principle over profit – and put country \nbefore company or union. Many in our country \ndo this – our uniformed officers in the military \nare an ideal example as they put their lives on \nthe line out of a deep belief in our values and \nour country. \nAmerica is still the exceptional nation, but its \nproblems demand that we adjust our strategies. \nAmerica has carried the burden of keeping the \nworld safe and has made extraordinary efforts, \nincluding through trade, to improve the lives of \nthe citizens of other nations. It is time to rebal-\nance and rebuild but not retreat from the post-\nworld order. A U.S. retreat from international \nleadership will leave a vacuum that may be filled \nby China or other actors that seek to promote an \nalternate set of international rules and norms. \nBoth parties contributed to our failures (and \nthe media amplifies it).\nMany of the grievances I’ve noted existed and \ngrew under both parties’ leadership. These \ngrievances are frequently amplified by media, \nboth traditional and new, that often adheres to \nonly one party’s views, which leaves audiences \nblind to all of the issues and consequences of \nflawed policies. For example, when conducting \ninterviews, reporters many times reveal their \nbiases whether through subtle support or open \nskepticism. Interview subjects may be discred-\nited because of who they are, not because of the \ncontent of their argument. Much of this is making \nus meaner to each other – a little more kindness \nand understanding would go a long way. I am  \na firm believer that we should constantly talk  \nwith each other, air our views, hold each other \naccountable and try to respect all sides of an \nargument.\nSocial media has made this worse, in fact, delib-\nerately worse by using algorithms to manipulate \nas opposed to educate. Networks and platforms \ncould meaningfully improve the quality of dis-\ncourse on the town square both by offering a \nmenu of algorithms, as opposed to ones that are \naddictive, and by requiring all users to authenti-\ncate their identities, whether they choose to \nspeak anonymously or not. In banking, we have \n“know your customer” requirements – social \nmedia should have them as well. Verifying iden-\ntities would go a long way toward eliminating \nforeign influence and bots, and would make  \nindividuals, not the platform, subject to the law. \nWe also exist in a nation awash with inaccurate \nand unfair labeling and scapegoating; i.e., Wall \nStreet versus Main Street. Who exactly is Wall \nStreet in this comparison with Main Street? Large \nbusiness and small business are symbiotic. \nShouldn’t we respect jobs and workers and the \ncompanies that create those jobs? And some \ngive voice to the view that public sector jobs are \nmore virtuous than private sector jobs. Less than \n25 million people work in the public sector and we \nshould hold them in high regard – teachers, \npolice, firefighters, military, sanitation workers \nand others. All jobs have dignity and purpose, \nand add to the general well-being of the country. \nIt is good to remember that the 135 million people \nwho work in the private sector generate the \nincome that funds the public sector. \nAll of these are among the reasons why I believe \nthe body politic may be tired and ready to see \nbold disruption. While we need to take proper \nactions, we also need reform and reconstruction. \nIn addition, our adversaries mistake our appar-\nent disarray as a sign that we are lazy, weak  \nand decadent. Anyone who knows America –  \nits work ethic, innovation and morality of most  \ncitizens – knows this is not true. \n19\n19\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

      "text": "RECOGNIZE THAT THE BEST STRATEGY \nFOR AMERICA’S SUCCESS IS TO \nIMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC \nPOLICIES THAT DRIVE ROBUST \nECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE BENEFIT \nOF ALL CITIZENS. \nWe need to address the underlying issues caus-\ning the grievances that are tearing us apart and \nholding the nation back. By enacting meaningful \npolicy reforms to resolve these issues, I believe \nour gross domestic product (GDP) would grow \nby over 3% a year – benefiting all Americans and \nespecially those in our lower-income communi-\nties. From 2000 to 2024, GDP grew by just over \n2% a year. Had it grown by 3%, which should be \neasily achievable with the right policy decisions, \nour GDP per person would be approximately \n$16,000 higher this year. \nIn this section and in the following, I describe \nmany of the policies that we need to fix – and, in \nsome cases, how to do it. Some of the fixes are \neasy, while others are more challenging. They \nrun the gamut from improving the supply side, \nsuch as education, infrastructure, permitting, \nproduction capability and technology, to \naddressing the demand side, including fiscal \nand tax policy. All of these are domestic policies, \nwhich we can fix on our own. Later in this section, \nI talk about foreign economic policies, including \ntrade, foreign investment and the U.S. dollar as \nthe world’s reserve currency, all of which are \nessential to our country and the world. \nPolicy needs to be detailed, comprehensive \nand coordinated to be successful – how you \ndescribe it politically is a separate matter.\nAs someone once said, “If you are going to do \nwhat you already did, you are going to get what \nyou already got.” We have the best economy in \nthe world, but we must confront our extensive \nflaws and fault lines. We need to build our own \ncapabilities and stop the constant under- and \nover-reaction. Our policies must foster healthy, \nsustainable growth, and it’s essential that we \nunite the entire nation – government and busi-\nness alike – to achieve it. Around the world, we \nobserve both effective and counterproductive \npolicies. For example, well-intentioned labor laws \ncan backfire, as seen in parts of Europe where \nrigid labor regulations have contributed to  \npersistently high unemployment. Similarly,  \ncertain safety net programs may inadvertently \ndiscourage paid work. On the other hand, stream-\nlined permitting policies show how smart gover-\nnance can accelerate development and get  \nprojects built – in short order and safely. Nations \nthat implement sound policies are capable  \nof achieving remarkable outcomes; consider  \nIreland, Singapore, South Korea and Sweden. \nEven Greece, which used to be Europe’s perennial \nbasket case, has managed to turn itself around, \ndriven by an exceptional political leader. \nGood political leaders get both the politics and \nthe policies, in detail, right. They are constantly \neducating the public instead of just responding \nto it. Our country needs leaders who can guide \ntheir parties away from catering to the extremes \nand who can collaborate effectively with our \nallies to craft integrated policies that address \nboth economic and security challenges – in the \nshort and long term. Most important, on the \nhome front, we need lawmakers on both sides  \nof the aisle to commit to the serious work of  \ngoverning – setting aside partisan divides to \ndevelop policies that foster economic growth \nand expand opportunities for all Americans to \nsucceed. Running for any executive office \n(mayor, governor or president) and running the \ngovernment are completely different things. \nSome quickly figure that out, and some don’t. \nWhile a good politician must communicate  \npolicies in a clear, compelling way that resonates \nwith the American public, the policies them-\nselves must be well designed to be truly effec-\ntive. And this is more important today than ever \nbefore because the future, for both foreign policy \nand economic policy, is fraught with extreme risk. \nWe need to promote, not denigrate, \nbusinesses, large and small. \nOn economic policy, the Republicans are right  \nto champion business and free enterprise, limit \nexcessive government intervention, establish an \ninternational tax system that has made America \ncompetitive for the first time in over 15 years, \nand cut back on needless, mind-numbing, \njob-killing regulations. And all of this could be \ndone while still maintaining the proper regula-\ntion necessary to prevent market abuses and \nsafeguard the economic environment. \nRecent Democratic policies, driven by \noften-misguided narratives and an often- \n20\n20\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

Many \ngovernment agencies and regulators frequently \ncriticize business by relying on oversimplified \nand dishonest concepts like “price gouging” to \njustify their stance. They tend to take the iso-\nlated missteps of a few companies and use them \nto paint the broader business community as \nunethical. This fuels rhetoric that undermines \nfree enterprise and leads to regulatory over-\nreach that frequently exceeds the intent of the \nlaw. Few in the previous administration actually \nunderstood business or had any experience run-\nning a business – and it showed. Other import-\nant policies (for example, infrastructure, the \nCHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction \nAct), while well-intentioned, were laden with vir-\ntue-signaling and uninformed rules, which limit \ntheir effectiveness. And instead of fixing endless \nregulations, like permitting, government effec-\ntively made them worse. \nIt would be wiser to properly educate the public \nabout the role of business, large and small. The \nprivate sector is the engine for investing our \ncountry’s capital into high-returning areas – it is \nour most effective tool for promoting innovation, \nsustainable growth, productivity and jobs. There \nare more than 30 million businesses in America, \nbut within the private sector, it is large compa-\nnies that are responsible for 85% of the research \nand development (R&D) and nearly half of all \nnonresidential capital investment. Big compa-\nnies generally have excellent healthcare, well-\nness, retirement and training programs. \nEvery time a new plant is built somewhere, it cre-\nates four or five times more jobs in that area, \nusually in small businesses. Small business and \nlarge business are truly symbiotic. \nINITIATE COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC \nFOREIGN POLICY TO WIN THE NEW \nGLOBAL “ECONOMIC” WAR. AMERICA \nWILL BE FIRST – BUT NOT IF IT IS ALONE. \nAmerica’s extraordinary standing in world \naffairs is predicated on our economic, military \nand moral strengths. Our exceptional relation-\nships with our allies largely exist both because \nof the security they receive from America’s mili-\ntary umbrella and our strong economic ties. But \nwe are in a new world defined by shifting power \ndynamics, rapid technological disruption and \nrising geopolitical tensions, including China’s \ngrowing assertiveness. This economic competi-\ntion and conflict will likely go on far longer than \nthe wars on the battlefield. \nThe autocratic nations of the world, and some  \nof the nonaligned nations, would like to see a \nfragmentation of America’s economic alliances \nand a weakening of our global economic posi-\ntion, including our status as the world’s most \npowerful economy, a leader in innovation and \nholder of the world’s reserve currency. This \ncompetition has many players, using many tac-\ntics, over many years. But our long-term strate-\ngic goals should be crystal clear: to maintain the \ncohesion and strength of the Western world, \nincluding their economies. If the Western world’s \nmilitary and economic alliances were to frag-\nment, America itself would inevitably weaken \nover time.\nEconomic fragmentation from our allies may \nbe disastrous in the long run.\nKeeping our alliances together, both militarily \nand economically, is essential. The opposite is \nprecisely what our adversaries want. Europe has \nsome serious issues to fix. Since 2008, the euro-\nzone’s GDP per person has gone from over 75% \nof U.S. GDP per person to approximately 50%. \nWhile Europe has received some tough mes-\nsages from U.S. leaders recently, what European \nleaders should do is seize the moment. Euro-\npean nations know what they need to do: signifi-\ncantly reform their economies so they can grow; \ne.g., finish the economic union to make com-\nmerce across their countries easier and more \nefficient, and initiate labor reform and tax reform \nto incent more business growth and more labor \nparticipation (see the Draghi report). They also \nrecognize that they need to materially increase \ntheir military spend and capabilities. This is \ngoing to be hard, but our country’s goal should \nbe to help make European nations stronger and \nkeep them close. \nIf Europe’s economic weakness leads to frag-\nmentation, the landscape will look a lot like the \nworld before World War II. Each nation will need \nto seek out its own relationships to secure its \nfuture, and that may very well mean closer rela-\ntionships with Russia and Iran for energy and \nChina for trade and economics. Such moves \nwould ultimately make these countries far more \nreliant on China and Russia – over time effectively \n21\n21\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

Economics is the \nlongtime glue, and America First is fine, as long \nas it doesn’t end up being America alone. \nWe do not need to fear China – we just need \nto get our act together.\nComprehensive economic policy is critical to \ncompete with China. There is no more conse-\nquential relationship for the world, and this rela-\ntionship will affect the whole Indo-Pacific region, \nespecially our allies: Australia, Japan, the Philip-\npines, South Korea and others. \nOver the last 20 years, China has been executing \na more comprehensive economic strategy than \nwe have. The country’s leaders have success-\nfully grown their nation and, depending on how \nyou measure it, have made China the largest or \nsecond-largest economy in the world. That said, \nmany people question China’s current economic \nfocus – it continues to be beset by many eco-\nnomic and domestic issues, particularly capital \nmisallocation, which have resulted in large real \nestate problems, a weakened financial system, \npolicies that inhibit entrepreneurs in their own \ncountry and an urgent need to accommodate a \nrapidly aging population.\nChina has its own national security concerns, as \nit is located in a very politically complex part of \nthe world. Many of China’s actions have caused \nits neighbors (e.g., Japan, Korea, the Philippines, \namong others) to start to re-arm and draw closer \nto the United States. It also surprises many \nAmericans to hear that while our country is \n100% energy sufficient, China needs to import \n10 million barrels of oil a day. It is clear that Chi-\nna’s new leadership has set a different course, \nwith a much more intense focus on national \nsecurity, military capability and internal devel-\nopment. That is its right, and we simply need to \nadjust to it.\nAmerica still has an enormously strong hand – \nplenty of food, water and energy; peaceful \nneighbors; and what remains the most prosper-\nous and dynamic economy the world has ever \nseen, with a per person GDP of over $86,000 a \nyear (this compares with China’s GDP per per-\nson of $13,000 in 2024). Most important, our \nnation is blessed with the benefit of true free-\ndom and liberty. \nStarting well over a decade ago, both business \nand government should have focused on certain \nproblems with China: unfair trade across multi-\nple dimensions and our reliance on China for \ncritical national security-related components. \nWhile we may always have a complex relation-\nship with China (made all the more complicated \nand serious by its actions in supporting Russia \nin the ongoing war with Ukraine), the country’s \nvast size and importance to so many other \nnations (China is the largest trading partner to \nalmost every other nation) require us to stay \nengaged – thoughtfully and without fear. At the \nsame time, we need to build and execute our \nown long-term, comprehensive economic secu-\nrity strategy to keep our position safe and \nsecure. For example, we need to remain com-\npetitive with China in the artificial intelligence \n(AI) race by bolstering our technological \nadvancements and reducing our reliance on Tai-\nwan for semiconductor chips. Most of the \nactions we can take to protect our country are \nunilateral and do not need China’s agreement. \nOverall, I believe that respectful, strong and con-\nsistent engagement would be best for both the \nUnited States and China, as well as the rest of \nthe world. \nWhether you view China as a competitor or a \npotential adversary, we should work with our \nallies to firmly negotiate an ongoing relationship. \nTough but thoughtful negotiations over strate-\ngic, military and economic concerns – including \nunfair competition – should lead to a better situ-\nation for all. If America provides strong leader-\nship, and keeps the Western world together, \nChina will be better off forming partnerships \nwith a strong Western world than with nations \nlike Russia, Iran and others. We should also rec-\nognize what critical common interests with \nChina we share in combating nuclear prolifera-\ntion, climate change and terrorism.\nWhat China does so well is manage its country as \na whole – coordinating government and business \nso that they are able to further some of their stra-\ntegic goals. We must improve our ability to act in \na more organized and strategic way to succeed in \nthis new global landscape. Simply put, if we keep \nour economy the strongest and maintain the \nstrength of our alliances, we will thrive. \n22\n22\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

      "text": "We should promote healthy economic \nalliances, which includes fair trade.\nGlobal trade is enormous, amounting to approxi-\nmately $20 trillion a year, of which only $2.5 tril-\nlion is with the United States. And global trade \nwill take place with or without us. We should \nremember that other nations have choices, both \nin the short term and in the long term, and they \nwill make these choices in their own self-interest \nbased on economics, security and reliability.\nMany countries need trade to help grow their \neconomies. The European Union, for example, \nhas the largest trade network with 40 individual \nagreements. China has applied for and signed \nseveral new trade agreements (e.g., the Regional \nComprehensive Economic Partnership, Digital \nEconomy Partnership Agreement, and Compre-\nhensive and Progressive Agreement for \nTrans-Pacific Partnership). The United States \nlacks trade agreements with some of its closest \nallies, many of whom have signed trade deals \nwith China. We should more actively be seeking \nfree (and, of course, fair) trade agreements, par-\nticularly with strong allies like Australia, Japan, \nthe United Kingdom and – we hope one day – \nthe European Union. These can be done in a way \nthat is clearly beneficial to both sides. \nWe already trade with most nations on the planet \n– and, of course, we should always be trying to \nmake it better and fairer for America. Deepening \nhigh-standard trade with key trading partners is \ngood economics and great geopolitics. And we \ndon’t need to ask many nonaligned nations, like \nIndia and Brazil, to align with us – but we can \nbring them closer to us by simply extending a \nfriendly hand with trade and investment.\nThere are many ways to combat unfair trade \n– industrial policy is one of them, but it should \nbe done right or not at all. \nFor hundreds of years, countries have used \ntrade practices to get a leg up on other coun-\ntries. This economic competition is often exer-\ncised through industrial and trade policy, and it \ncomes in many forms: banning or limiting trade \n(quotas), tariffs, subsidies, grants, tax credits or \naccelerated depreciation, loan guarantees, long-\nterm purchase agreements and capital controls. \nThese tools are generally intended to give a \ncompany or an industry an unfair competitive \nadvantage, and when used together, they can \ncreate unbeatable economies of scale. In their \nharshest form, they can be used by countries  \nas a tactic to try to unfairly dominate whole \nindustries. This should not be allowed.\nThere are other unfair trade practices that need \nto be mentioned; e.g., nontrade barriers, such as \nregulations that effectively stop specific types \nof trade and various unfair tax policies that \nrange from value-added taxes to a particular \ncountry’s tax schemes. Many countries use \nsome of these tools in various forms (including \nthe United States).\nSo trade agreements have many flaws and need \nto be carefully negotiated. Practices such as \npermitting countries to circumvent trade restric-\ntions imposed on them – for example, allowing \nChina to use agreements that it has with other \nnations to bypass tariffs on Chinese goods – can \nand should be stopped. Obviously, where the \nUnited States is treated unfairly, we should \ndemand that those agreements be fixed. It \nwould also be good to acknowledge that we \nhave sometimes treated others unfairly (for \nexample, parts of the Inflation Reduction Act \nunfairly favor American business). \nIndustrial policy mechanisms, when used, \nshould be as targeted and as simple as possible. \nThe cleanest of these is tax credits in various \nforms. Whatever the policy, two rules should not \nbe violated: (1) there should be no social engi-\nneering and (2) markets should allocate capital, \nnot the government – lest the result is a buffet \nwhere corporate America gorges. The govern-\nment is simply not good at allocating capital in a \nfree market. One example should suffice: In our \nattempt to create a more competitive chip man-\nufacturing industry in the United States (it costs \ntwo times more to manufacture these chips in \nAmerica, and, therefore, our manufacturers \nwould fail if they tried to compete), the govern-\nment could have given land grants for the land, \naccelerated depreciation and lowered taxes or \noffered tax credits for an extended period. Then \nthe companies and the capital markets would \nhave competed to decide how best to do this. \nNonetheless, we need to acknowledge that \nthere have been real negative job impacts as a \nresult of trade (in 1990, manufacturing created \n18 million jobs in this country versus 13 million \ntoday), which are usually concentrated around \ncertain geographic areas and businesses.

And  \nwe should do this while maintaining our close \neconomic relations with our allies. \nWhat’s the truth about trade deficits? \nTrade deficits, by their nature, are not necessar-\nily good or bad. Even if our country had no net \ntrade deficit, it would likely be running deficits \nwith some countries and surpluses with others. \nSometimes a high trade deficit results from a \ncountry’s extraordinary attractiveness as an \nopen investment destination, and these invest-\nments help that country grow and prosper. This \nmay be true for part of America’s trade deficit. \nHowever, trade deficits for pure consumption \nmay mean a country is slowly selling parts of \nitself to someone else, and I’m not sure that’s  \na good idea. \nOur trade deficit over the last 20 years has \ntotaled over $12 trillion, and this is probably too \nlarge. The other side to the trade deficit is an \ninvestment surplus, which has resulted over the \nyears in foreign investors owning $30 trillion of \nU.S. securities, while U.S. investors own only  \n$16 trillion of foreign securities. In 2005, these \nnumbers were $6.3 trillion and $4.3 trillion, \nrespectively. You can see that, over time, foreign \ninvestors have come to own an increasing share \nof the United States. (For your information,  \nChina’s holdings of U.S. assets are approximately \n$1.5 trillion, of which half is U.S. Treasury \nsecurities.) \nIt is good to remember that our trade deficit  \nis also driven by our large government deficit. \nTherefore, it is perfectly reasonable for us to \nfocus on our “twin” deficits: our $2 trillion fiscal \ndeficit and our $1 trillion trade deficit. While the \nnumbers in the above paragraph highlight the \nattractiveness of the American economy, they \nalso reveal certain underlying risks: If America, \nfor whatever reason, becomes a less-attractive \ninvestment destination, the U.S. dollar and the \neconomy could suffer if foreigners sold their \nU.S. assets. \nOur extraordinary energy position is a \nmassive competitive advantage, ensuring \naffordable, reliable, safe and ever cleaner \nenergy, both for us and critically for our allies. \nThe United States has a huge competitive  \nadvantage in that it is essentially self-sufficient on \nenergy – and will be for decades. This reduces \nthe cost of so many things in our country (e.g., up \nto 40% of the cost of food is related to energy) \nand makes it much easier for American compa-\nnies to compete. It’s also an enormous geopoliti-\ncal benefit for us to be able to export safe, afford-\nable, secure liquefied natural gas overseas to our \nallies. This binds them to us, gives them greater \nsecurity and is economically beneficial for the \nUnited States. It also has the virtue of being good \nfor the climate – as cleaner liquefied natural gas \nreplaces dirtier coal.\nAmerica should lead the way in generating more \nenergy to meet greater demand, including from \nAI, which will require huge amounts of energy. \nAnd we need an “all of the above” strategy for \ndeveloping renewable energy, as well as tapping \nconventional energy sources. We should not  \nforget that to make energy ever more efficient \nand cleaner, we also need more rapid permit-\nting, investment in the grid and access to critical \nminerals. I am convinced that, over time, our \ninnovative capabilities will make energy cleaner \nand solve the carbon emissions problem. \nIn this country, we have made many mistakes \naround climate policy – and I believe a lot of \nmoney will ultimately be wasted. We also made \nmany bad decisions. For example, we failed to \nbuild the pipeline that would bring gas from \nPennsylvania to New York – this would have \nreplaced coal (in a cleaner way) and dramatically \ndecreased the cost of energy for New Yorkers. \nIt’s also important to remember that pollution  \nin the United States was significantly reduced \nbecause we effectively outsourced the produc-\ntion of “dirty” manufacturing, like steel, to other \nnations that have lower emissions standards \nthan we do. \nOne last point: Billions of people around the \nworld still lack access to affordable and reliable \nenergy, a fundamental driver of higher and \nhealthier living standards. Meeting this demand \nimproves lives on a global scale. \n24\n24\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

      "text": "There are many other critical foreign \neconomic policies that could be used to \npromote the American economy and protect \nour allies. \nEssentially, they are: \n•\t We must keep America’s tax system interna-\ntionally competitive so as not to drive capital, \ncompanies, intellectual property or people \noverseas. There is a complexity to this \nbecause so many countries play games with \ntheir tax systems – but staying competitive \ncan be done. It would be a huge mistake for \nAmerica to put itself at a disadvantage – there \nare better ways to collect taxes (more on \ntaxes in the next section).\n•\t U.S. development finance institutions, includ-\ning the two main ones (the U.S. International \nDevelopment Corporation and the Export- \nImport Bank of the United States), are gener-\nally used to develop projects in and support \nexports from developing nations. Our devel-\nopment finance is very small relative to the \nsize of our country – in total, America’s devel-\nopment finance investment is approximately \n$60 billion. We are virtually absent compared \nwith China. By contrast, China’s government- \nled Belt and Road initiative has lent or invested \n$1.4 trillion in 155 different countries. China \ndoes this to promote its business expansion \noverseas and to enhance its own energy,  \nminerals or supply chains. \nIn addition to the Belt and Road initiative, China \nhas foreign direct investment of approximately \n$3 trillion in the rest of the world. This invest-\nment was virtually zero in 2000. By compari-\nson, America’s foreign direct investment totals \n$6.7 trillion. In my travels in Africa and Latin \nAmerica, the absence of American business or \ngovernment investment is palpable. African \nand Latin American nations want more of \nAmerica, but they are getting what they need \nfrom China. Done right, America could dramat-\nically increase its development finance – it is \nnot a giveaway, it can be quite profitable, and it \nhas the virtue of promoting America and its \nbusinesses overseas.\n•\t We need to do a better job, in general, of pro-\nmoting American business overseas. Ameri-\nca’s development institutions can work with \nAmerican businesses far more effectively, for \ninstance, by providing political insurance on \nlarge capital investments. This insurance \nwould protect businesses and enable them  \nto make investments in unstable regions by \ncovering risks like government takeovers or \npolitical unrest. \nAt the same time, while laws like the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act have helped reduce \ncorruption and level the playing field abroad, \nsuch laws often put firms at a disadvantage, \nincluding American firms and international \nfirms with a U.S. nexus. The rules can be \nvague, the guidelines are ambiguous and the \npenalties are steep – making impacted  \ncompanies hesitant to compete. This needs  \nto be fixed. \n•\t We need to constantly educate and inform the \nworld about America’s values and virtues. We \ndon’t need to be condescending or lecturing, \njust consistently educating and sharing – the \nlore of freedom and democracy combined \nwith a gentle assist will eventually win the day. \nAmerica’s strong economy plays a critical \nrole in preserving the U.S. dollar as the \nworld’s reserve currency.\nThe U.S. dollar is a “fiat” currency. Some say  \nthis makes the dollar purely a matter of trust. \nThis is simply not true. The Federal Reserve, \nwhich issues dollars, owns assets (mostly U.S. \nTreasuries) supporting each dollar it issues. \nThose assets carry the full faith of the U.S.  \ngovernment, backed by its taxing power on the \nmost prosperous nation the world has ever seen. \nIf you have U.S. dollars, you are essentially free \nto do with them as you see fit – that is not true in \nmany autocratic nations. The U.S. dollar is the \nworld’s reserve currency because of America’s \nopen markets, the strength of our economy and \nour rule of law upholding property rights – all \nprotected by the U.S. military. These are also the \nreasons why the United States is such an attrac-\ntive investment destination for anyone wanting \nto invest their money. \nA well-functioning international monetary sys-\ntem is good for the United States and for our \nallies, particularly since the rules are set by us \nand our allies (although some reform is needed). \nThe U.S. dollar is foundational to a healthy global \neconomic system, and it’s the cornerstone of \nAmerica’s commanding global influence. The \nstrength of our financial system gives America \nconsiderable clout, not only in allocating capital \n25\n25\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

People around the world actually carry \napproximately $2.5 trillion of paper U.S. dollars, \nwhich, in effect, is borrowing without paying \ninterest. \nThere is a correlation between the strength of \nour economic and military alliances and our  \nstatus as reserve currency: The stronger our alli-\nances, the stronger our reserve currency status. \nHowever, the opposite is also true. History has \nshown that as countries become weaker, their \ncurrency loses reserve currency status. \nAFFIRM THAT OUR NATIONAL \nSECURITY AND THE WORLD’S BEST \nMILITARY, AT WHATEVER COST, ARE \nPARAMOUNT AND NECESSARY FOR \nPEACE. \nIn today’s troubled world, we’ve seen several \nstark reminders that national security is and \nalways will be paramount even if that idea seems \nto recede in tranquil times. America remains the \narsenal of democracy and the bastion of free-\ndom for the whole world. We must explain to the \nAmerican public, over and over, how Ukraine \nand the terrorist activity in Israel, fueled mainly \nby the Iranian regime, are the actual battlefields \nof freedom. It is our hope that these terrible \nevents have awakened all of us to the fact that \nthe world is never safe. As President Ronald \nReagan once wisely said, “The only way to stay \nsafe is peace through strength.” Having the best \nmilitary is expensive, but it is not nearly as \nexpensive as dealing with what would happen \nwithout it. We must maintain the world’s  \nstrongest military, without question. \nOf course, it is reasonable to expect allies to pay \ntheir fair share of global military expenses – but \nwe should also recognize that it is in our own \nstrategic self-interest to keep our allies together. \nThe U.S. military presence around the world \nshould not be viewed as mere protection for hire \n– it’s a critical pillar of global stability and a \nreflection of our leadership. \nWe hope one day there will be a lasting and per-\nmanent peace for Israel and the Middle East. \nUkraine needs a proper resolution – one that \nprovides it with sovereignty, stability and secu-\nrity – putting their country on a path to healthy \ngrowth. Sovereignty means that they are a free \nnation left to make their own decisions. If \nUkraine is left in a weakened position (meaning, \nessentially, that Russia succeeded), we will see  \na fracturing of America’s military alliances as \ncountries, Europe in particular, search for better \nsecurity arrangements. \nOne more point about military security: There \nwas always a thought that America was far from \nEuropean wars, even though we have been \ndragged into them many times. With the advent \nof cyber war, satellites and hypersonic missiles, \nthe world has changed; other countries’ military \ncapabilities are already on our doorstep. \nWe need to employ all instruments of national \npower. \nThe exercise of power isn’t measured by military \nforce alone but also includes other instruments \nof national power: diplomacy, economic devel-\nopment, foreign assistance (all done in a strate-\ngic, efficient and accountable way) and constant \neducation about the benefits of freedom. Again, \nas President Reagan said, “Freedom is special \nand rare. It’s fragile; it needs protection.” Funda-\nmentally, we need to realize that power is also \nbased on trust: trust that we will do the right \nthing, that we can do the right thing and that we \nare not just strong but reliable. \nWe need to immediately change certain \npolicies to secure and enhance our military \ncapabilities. \nSustaining America’s position of power requires \nmajor changes in the funding and planning of \nour military. This includes major changes in \ntrade, production capacity and supply chains to \nmake our military as resilient and capable as \npossible. Some specifics will suffice: \n26\n26\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

This costs the military billions of dollars  \na year and creates instability and uncertainty \nfor the defense industry. Switching to multi-\nyear plans could potentially provide $40 billion \nin savings a year (out of a 2024 Defense \nDepartment budget of almost $850 billion) \nand greater stability for the military. \n•\t We need to allow greater flexibility on the  \nreallocation of money; i.e., to continuously \ninnovate (buy the newest drones and other \nitems).\n•\t Our stockpiles of vital munitions are seriously \ninadequate – if there was a war in the South \nChina Sea, we would run out of missiles in \nseven days. If it were up to me, I would be \nstockpiling ammunition, air and missile \ndefense, rare earths and other critical com-\nponents, importantly to preserve peace.\n•\t We don’t maintain sufficient excess produc-\ntion capacity in our defense industrial base to \nramp up the production of weapons, if neces-\nsary. We don’t even have the proper capacity \nto build battleships anymore. It would be \nrather easy for the government to work with \nthe private sector to help maintain factories \ncapable of producing military materials that \nwould be required at a wartime pace. \n•\t We also lack sufficient labor necessary to do \neverything outlined above. It can take up to six \nyears to train workers on the complex skills \nthat are needed to manufacture this equip-\nment – and we don’t have six years. \n•\t We need to immediately restructure some of \nour trade and supply chains. Surprisingly, \nmany of the essential items we would need in \ncase of war would come from potential adver-\nsaries. These products range from rare earths \nto penicillin and other pharmaceutical ingredi-\nents to certain types of steel, semiconductors \nand even some manufactured components. \nWe need to use all of the tools at our disposal \nto do this as expeditiously as possible.\n•\t Taking the proper unilateral actions on very \ntargeted investment and export restrictions \n(chip making equipment, advanced chips and \nother hard-to-duplicate technology used for \nmilitary purposes) is essential. However, we \nshould only expect these kinds of actions to \nslow down our competition, not necessarily \nstop it. \n•\t Finally, the extraordinary science that comes \nout of our national labs and our exceptional \nuniversities has been critical to creating  \nand maintaining our scientific discoveries  \nand advances, which have not only fueled \nAmerica’s economy but have also maintained \nour military superiority. There are lots of  \ncomplaints – some legitimate – about  \nAmerica’s elite universities, but this cannot \nand should not be one of them. \nProtecting our country goes way beyond just the \nmilitary and includes, among other items, grid \nsecurity, data centers, communications and \ncybersecurity in general.\nForeign policy is realpolitik. \nAmerica’s alliance system is the foundation of \nour geopolitical advantage and is the special \nsauce of American leadership. Foreign policy \nmust be grounded in realpolitik – a pragmatic \napproach that prioritizes national interest over \nideological considerations. Realpolitik means \nthat many decisions are properly subordinated \nto national security. For example, while address-\ning global challenges, like climate change, is \nimportant, such efforts should not overshadow \nthe strategic imperatives of our foreign \nrelations. \nWe need to bring our allies along and help them \nbuild their own capabilities. A weak Europe is \nultimately very bad for America. Among other \nthings, our allies need reliable, safe, secure and \naffordable energy – or they will be in a terrible \nposition. Diplomacy and our economic relation-\nships, including trade, are a critical part of main-\ntaining these alliances. While we should educate \nother nations about the virtues of our values, we \nshould stop lecturing – we don’t need them to \nhave all our values, but we do need them to be \nstrong allies.\n27\n27\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW",

By doing so, we create \nthe resources to constantly reinvest in our \ncountry, and we create the conditions to pro-\nmote greater opportunity and well-being for all \nour citizens. In this section, I describe nine criti-\ncal policies that I believe are essential to making \nour economy strong – putting us in the best \nposition to deal with any issue in front of us, \neconomic or geopolitical, and guaranteeing our \nongoing military and economic predominance. \nIn compiling this list, I tried to look at the United \nStates as I would any large complex company \nthat we might acquire. (Of course, our country is \nmuch more complicated than any one com-\npany.) A full assessment of all critical issues \nallows you to develop a game plan. The issues \nI’ve highlighted – and there may be more – are \nthose that I believe are holding us back and \ncausing much of the “grievances” I wrote about \nin the first section. In all cases, I tried to be prac-\ntical in my approach, and, in some cases, I offer \nideas for potential fixes. \nI tried to look at this without regard to how posi-\ntions might be labeled; i.e., conservative, liberal, \nprogressive, red or blue. Whether my views are \nright or wrong, it is critical that we start to fix \nthat which is broken.\nGovernment as a whole needs to demonstrate \nto the American public that it is effective, \nefficient, competent and principled – as any \ninstitution should do – in developing policies \nthat are conducive to maximizing long-term \ngrowth, jobs, competitiveness and fairness – \nwithout micromanaging the economy.\nThe government, like all institutions, should  \ncontinuously prioritize and allocate resources to \nstreamline its operations and reduce red tape to \nimprove service delivery, enhance responsive-\nness and achieve cost efficiencies. Every \ndepartment should focus not just on the amount \nof money spent but on what it expects the out-\ncomes should be, what the outcomes actually \nare and how it can deliver more at a lower cost. \nInstead, we have a broken bureaucracy that fails \nto fully acknowledge or effectively deal with our \nbiggest problems. Even worse, the power of the \ngovernment over the years has been used to \nattack parties, businesses and individuals, par-\nticularly those not in favor by the party in power. \nThis needs to stop. It begins by always remind-\ning the American public about the founding \nprinciples of the United States of America – the \nprinciples embedded in our Declaration of Inde-\npendence and the Constitution – liberty, free-\ndom, individual rights and justice for all. \nThe economic machine is extraordinarily  \ncomplex. We need to focus on proper policies \nthat are conducive to growth. Micromanaging \ncoupled with misguided, ill-informed policies \nnot based on reality and pragmatism often  \nhave huge unintended consequences. People \nfrequently twist accurate data with bad logic to \nkill good policy. Many times, it is easier to throw \nmoney at a problem, mostly on the demand side \n(i.e., spend more money), than to formulate good \npolicy or spend money appropriately to help the \nsupply side.

This is a huge mis-\ntake. We should foster innovation and then cre-\nate policies that help those who are negatively \naffected.\nWE NEED CONSISTENT AND \nRESPONSIBLE TAX AND FISCAL \nPOLICIES. \nAmerica could benefit from a bipartisan, binding \nmechanism to achieve fiscal responsibility, simi-\nlar to a Simpson-Bowles type of commission – \nbut with real congressional authority. Some \ncountries, such as Sweden, have implemented a \nfiscal policy framework with specific guidelines. \nSweden’s framework establishes a debt-to-GDP \nratio of 35% plus or minus 5%. This allows the \ncountry to run deficit financing at the same rate \nas its economic growth and still maintain a debt-\nto-GDP ratio of 35%. Adhering to this kind of \nconsistent fiscal standard makes it easier to \nmanage the country in general. The United \nStates should eventually establish similar guide-\nlines that would make it easier to run this “ship of \nstate” and reduce the uncertainty that results \nfrom constant flip-flopping between sometimes \nradically different fiscal policies. \nAdditionally, we should eliminate the debt ceil-\ning. The debt ceiling is essentially a “weapon of \nmass destruction” that can be misused by politi-\ncians who don’t understand the damage it can \ndo. It’s hard to even contemplate the harm that \nwould be done to the trust in America and in our \neconomy if we actually failed to meet our debt \nobligations. \nWe must learn to account for investments \ndifferently from the way we account for \nexpenses, particularly in areas such as \ninfrastructure.\nThe lack of proper accounting by the U.S. govern-\nment is astounding and is almost laughable. \nUnfortunately, the practice drives terrible deci-\nsion making. For example, in determining the \ndeficit, the government treats investments in \ninfrastructure (roads, hospitals, ports) the same \nway that it treats expenses. But we should put \nthem in completely different budgetary catego-\nries. Good investment spending has long-term \nproductivity benefits that many expenses do not. \nThe United States now spends only 0.55% of its \nGDP on infrastructure. The OECD average is at \n0.81%, and China’s is a staggering 5.56%. We \nneed to spend more money on productive infra-\nstructure, not less. Borrowing to invest is funda-\nmentally different from borrowing to consume.\nThe government also makes a lot of loans, but it \ndoesn’t have to account for them in the same \nway that a bank does – which makes bad lending \neasy to do. For example, the government contin-\nues to extend a significant amount of student \nloans with improper or no underwriting. When \nthe student loan system was taken over by the \ngovernment in 2010, loan losses had been rea-\nsonable, and loans outstanding were $750 bil-\nlion. Through the magic of government account-\ning, the government actually forecasted more \nthan $60 billion in profit from when they took \nover the program. Thirteen years later, the out-\nstanding debt from student loans has more than \ndoubled to $1.6 trillion, and we estimate that the \ngovernment has lost, with proper accounting, at \nleast $500 billion. Yet the government continues \nto make many of these bad loans. \nThe stakes are even higher regarding the gov-\nernment’s control of two of the largest financial \ninstitutions in the world, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac, whose combined assets of $7.7 trillion \nlargely represent mortgages these organiza-\ntions have guaranteed. It is incumbent on our \ngovernment to properly manage institutions like \nthese to protect U.S. taxpayers from tremen-\ndous losses (they lost $265 billion in the great \nfinancial crisis) and to shield U.S. and global \neconomies from severe damage. \nTo make the U.S. tax system conducive to \neconomic growth and job creation, we should \nincorporate these overall objectives:\n•\t Be agnostic to specific industries, setting \naside favoritism. \n•\t Offer a system that is stable with standards \nconsistently applied. \n•\t Ensure that our practices keep the United \nStates competitive with other countries.\n•\t Provide effective incentives for growth and \ninnovation. \nA COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING\n29",

      "text": "The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) took  \nsignificant steps toward achieving these goals \nby (1) broadening the tax base, (2) reducing the \nfederal corporate rate to 21% (which is approxi-\nmately the OECD average) and (3) reforming the \ninternational tax rules. The first point is some-\ntimes forgotten: While the reduction of the head-\nline tax rate from 35% to 21% was projected to \nreduce corporate taxes by $1.4 trillion (over 10 \nyears), the broadening of the base offset $1  \ntrillion of that reduction. Regarding international \ntax rules, a key part of that reform was the \nremoval of gimmicks that allowed U.S. corpora-\ntions to indefinitely defer tax rules on their over-\nseas earnings. As a result, our international tax \nsystem strikes about the right balance between \nrecognizing the importance to U.S. companies \nof serving overseas markets while not incentiv-\nizing them to move capital, skills and R&D outside \nthe country. \nAlthough there is certainly room for improve-\nment, overall, the changes made by the TCJA \nrecognize that reducing and rationalizing taxes \non business income are critical to spurring eco-\nnomic growth and producing more “bang for the \nbuck” than cutting taxes on individual income. \nImportantly, these reforms benefited most \nAmericans. In the first two years after the TCJA \nwent into effect, we saw real median income rise \nmore than in the previous 10 years and the low-\nest unemployment rate for adults without a high \nschool diploma.\nIn the year following enactment, we also saw \nGDP growth of 3% and a 20% increase in domes-\ntic investment for affected firms. Corporate \ntaxes paid have risen to record levels – not \nbecause the tax burden on corporations was \nincreased, but because corporations were  \nmore profitable; they were doing more business, \nhiring more people, making more investments. \nNone of this would have been possible without  \na competitive corporate tax rate.\nOur Internal Revenue Code can be further \namended to incentivize growth and ensure a \nfairer tax system overall. \nOn the first point, our tax system should provide \neffective incentives for growth and innovation to \nsupport entrepreneurs and small businesses. \nTwo such examples were in the tax code for \ndecades before Congress recently phased them \nout: (1) recognizing the importance of capital \ninvestments and (2) increasing expenditures for \nR&D. Both are proven ways of growing the econ-\nomy and creating jobs.\nAs to ensuring a fairer system, there are still \nnumerous provisions for Congress to go after. \nOn the business side, the rules intended to pre-\nvent artificial shifting of taxable income outside \nthe United States need strengthening and a \nnumber of specific industry tax breaks need \neliminating. On the individual side, there are also \nmany tax breaks that primarily benefit a certain \nsegment of the population: the wealthy. These \ninclude carried interest, the ability to deduct up \nto $10,000 of state and local taxes, and too \nmany creative estate tax planning techniques. \nThese tax breaks not only cost revenue but also \nhave the additional stigma of being perceived by \nthe American public as just another example of \ninstitutional bias and favoritism toward a special \ninterest group. And consistent with ensuring a \nfairer system, the U.S. tax code should incorpo-\nrate the “Buffett Rule” so that high-income  \nearners pay a minimum tax on realized income. \nEveryone, including the wealthy, would benefit \nenormously from the increased growth that \nwould follow if we amended our system the  \nright way. I think many people would have fewer \nobjections to paying a slightly higher tax rate if \nthey thought the money was being used wisely \nto attack America’s biggest problems.\nFinally, the tax code plays an important role in \nhelping to raise up those at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder. This includes incentives to \nensure an adequate and affordable housing  \nsupply, such as the credit provision for building \naffordable housing. It’s important that any tax \ncredit and social benefit program be properly \nphased in so that it doesn’t dis-incent work. One \nway the code could incentivize labor force par-\nticipation is to expand and reform the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit (EITC).

It would give those with lower income far \nmore money to spend, without government \ninterference, on what they and their families \nneed – education, food, better housing and \nmore. And much of it would be spent locally, in \nlower-income neighborhoods.

For many peo-\nple, that first job is just the first rung on the lad-\nder of a career. I have little doubt that this plan \nwould more than pay for itself over time. Many \nRepublicans and Democrats support this pro-\ngram as it helps create the American Dream for \nmany people.\nOUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS IN DEEP \nNEED OF REFORM TO CREATE SKILLS, \nJOBS AND OPPORTUNITY. \nMuch of our education system no longer truly \nmeets our country’s promise that its students \ngraduate with the skills they need to attain a \ngood job. The American Dream itself rests upon \nour providing, as best as we can, equal opportu-\nnity to all our citizens. Education and jobs are \nstill the best way to achieve this. That certainly \ncan’t happen when so many of our schools are \nnot working. \nIn a number of our inner-city high schools, under \n50% of the students graduate, and those who do \noften don’t have the skills they need to hold a \nwell-paying job. Increasingly, poverty has \nbecome intergenerational.\nThe growth of America was always driven by \nproductivity that matched capital investment \nwith skills, which is also the driver of individual \nincomes. Fortunately, all we need to do is reori-\nent what we do today. No investment is required. \nIt is essentially free; we just need to redirect \nexisting resources (the United States spends \nalmost $1 trillion a year on K-12 education) into \nbetter outcomes. \nLet’s begin with a refresh of our country’s \nworkforce training system.\nEffective workforce training systems that align \neducation, training and the private sector are \nnecessary for securing well-paying jobs. There \nare many successful examples, but one will suf-\nfice. Aviation High School in Long Island City, \nNew York, teaches its students not just the basic \nhigh school curriculum but also how to maintain \nsmall aircraft; i.e., hydraulic, engine and electri-\ncal systems, and other technical skills. Some \nstudents travel several hours a day to get to \nschool, and often parents are the driving force \nbehind their child’s enrollment. The school  \ngraduates about 450 students annually, many of \nwhom go directly into the aviation field. These \nyoung people are currently earning in the range \nof $80,000 a year (not including overtime) from \nmajor U.S. airlines who are in desperate need of \nthese types of skilled workers. \nSchools like this are the template we need to \nfollow, modernizing education and workforce \ndevelopment programs to be responsive to  \ncurrent workforce needs. The advent of AI and \ntechnological change will require lifelong learn-\ning and re-skilling. Career and Technical Educa-\ntion programs and alternative pathways, such as \napprenticeships, earn-and-learn programs and \nwork-based learning, also provide effective \ncareer entryways.\nReforms to credentialed programs could also \nincrease access to careers with a future and \nreward experience. We know exactly what to do, \nthough systems change is hard. There are mil-\nlions of jobs available for which training could be \ndone in high school, community college or spe-\ncial programs outside of school.

These trainings \nshould be certified and counted as credits for \nundergraduate or graduate education. Many \nunions run excellent apprenticeship and training \nprograms that certify workers for badly needed \nhigh skilled jobs like welding, electrical work, \nplumbing and others. These jobs can pay well in \nexcess of $100,000 a year. \nTwo other points: Pell Grants, which are govern-\nment grants awarded to students to help pay for \neligible two-year or four-year colleges, should \nbe available for work credential programs. In \naddition, the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-\ntunity Act should be reauthorized to support \nSecond Chance initiatives that give returning \nfelons an opportunity to receive training to \nre-enter the workforce. \nHigher education costs too much and is \ninsufficiently linked to outcomes.\nMany people who graduate from college are \nsuccessful not solely because of their college \ndegree. Their opportunities stem from their \nsocioeconomic circumstances – how and where \nthey grew up – which offer them knowledge, \nconfidence, and often internships and relation-\nships within the workplace that give them a leg \nup.

This \nwould be better for the student, would reduce \nfuture loan losses and would discourage simply \ndriving education costs up.\nEarly childhood education is critically \nimportant (it’s a long-term investment so \nstart now).\nEarly childhood education is a long-term invest-\nment so it is important to start now. Universal \npre-K and other early childhood programs \nenhance educational outcomes and increase \nparent labor-force participation. Almost every \nstudy I have seen shows the tremendous return \non this investment (some even showing two to \nfour times for every dollar invested) even though \nit appears as a cost in the early years. Included \namong the positive outcomes for both the par-\nent and the child are early childhood education \nand higher levels of income, good health and \nparental employment. \nAll students should receive a basic financial \neducation.\nFinancial education should be taught as part of \nthe K-12 education system. Everyone, and in par-\nticular our young people, should understand the \nbasics: the need for a rainy day fund, how to look \nat savings, the value of a checking account  \n(versus payday lending), the value of homeown-\nership, the importance of saving for retirement \nand other basic principles. Specific financial \ncoaching delivered simultaneously with opening \na first bank account would also be very effective. \nTeaching health and well-being in grades \nK-12 would benefit all our citizens.\nA basic understanding of health, exercise and \nnutrition would be a huge benefit for our society. \nNinety percent of our nation’s $4.5 trillion in \nannual healthcare expenditures are for people \nwith chronic conditions (certain cancers, heart \ndisease, diabetes, obesity, musculoskeletal dis-\norders and mental health). Preventive medicine \nand early interventions to manage these dis-\neases, especially those directly related to \nbehaviors (smoking, drinking, poor exercise and \nnutrition) can have significant health and eco-\nnomic benefits. One small but meaningful exam-\nple: Cigarette smoking costs the United States \nmore than $240 billion in healthcare spending. \nThis could be reduced every year if we could \nprevent young people from starting to smoke \nand help those who do smoke to quit. \nA COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING\n32",

Some studies show \nthat over the last 25-30 years, this may have \naccounted for as much as 45% of productivity \ngrowth over time. Healthier workers and the par-\nticipation of older workers (due to their accumu-\nlated knowledge and wisdom) are the main \nreasons. \nWE CAN IMPROVE EFFECTIVE \nREGULATIONS WHILE REDUCING \nCRIPPLING RULES, DEMORALIZATION, \nAND ARBITRARY AND EXPENSIVE \nLITIGATION. \nI don’t even know where to begin! How did the \ncan-do, commonsense practical America end \nup here? Clearly, something is broken. We have \ngotten to the point where we barely talk about \nimproving our regulations. We only talk about \nadding more – contributing to endless, \nmind-numbing and demoralizing bureaucracy. \nStudies show that the cost of our regulations \n(which do have some productive outcomes) is \nover $3 trillion annually. J.P. Morgan Global \nResearch estimates that relative to the United \nStates, more restrictive regulation reduces long-\nterm growth in the five largest European Union \neconomies by 0.8% per year, and in China by \n2.4% per year. These regulations are at the fed-\neral, state and local levels, and they affect every \nindustry and business, small and large. They \nrange from permitting and licensing to employ-\nment rules and tax compliance (and much \nmore). Each of these rules could easily be fixed. \nTake permitting, for example. Various regula-\ntors, state and federal, should be forced to \napprove projects sequentially. Some countries \n(Singapore and Canada) have rules to reduce \npermitting timelines substantially to two years \nor fewer (ours can take over 10 years). Regula-\ntions shouldn’t be like concrete (immovable) – \nthey should be constantly improved.

Often these regulations are targeted at the \nfinancial and technology sectors, whose indus-\ntries help drive our dynamic economy. \nThe cost of our tort system is over $500 billion a \nyear, a little more than 2% of our GDP. While the \ntort system plays an important role in compen-\nsating victims and deterring irresponsible \nbehavior, our system is capricious and arbitrary. \nSince the loser never pays, there is a great \nincentive for someone to sue and for the person \nbeing sued to settle. Much of the compensation \nnever even gets to the victims. These costs  \nare two-and-a-half times the average level of \neurozone countries. One example of a major \nimprovement would be Florida’s recent reforms, \nwhich seem to have both reduced the excessive \ncost of torts to the system while giving people \nbetter odds of proper recompense.\nThese excessive regulatory and litigation costs \nresult in higher costs across the whole economy, \nincluding infrastructure, utilities, education and \nother essentials. Proper federal, state and local \nregulations, along with permitting reform, are \nnecessary to reduce delays and litigation. Mini-\nmizing red tape would make it easier, cheaper \nand faster to build infrastructure such as roads, \nschools, bridges, energy facilities and homes. A \nlittle common sense would go a long way.\nOne last point: Excessive regulations make  \nit much harder to start a new business, and \nthey often reduce competition. And they \nalmost always hurt smaller companies more \nthan larger ones. \nWE COULD DO A BETTER JOB \nSUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES. \nSmall businesses power job growth in America \n– they account for two-thirds of new jobs and \nemploy nearly half of the American workforce. \nOur entrepreneurial ecosystem has been the \nenvy of the world for generations, and it is \nessential to create a policy environment that \nfacilitates small business creation, growth and \ncontinuity. \nBusiness starts have been above-trend for sev-\neral years, but the failure rate remains high – \n50% fail in the first five years. Public-private \npartnerships can help fill the capital gap in the \nwhite space between venture funding and bank \nlending. \nSmall business owners in low-to-moderate \nincome areas face more headwinds than those \nin wealthier communities, so tax benefits and \ncommunity education programs play an import-\nant role in helping communities lift themselves \nup through commerce. While banks will remain a \ncritical supporter of small business in their \ngrowth phase, the Small Business Administra-\ntion’s role is crucial and agency modernization \nmust remain a priority, including reforms to the \nSmall Business Investment Company program \nand the National Technical Assistance program. \nFinding qualified talent is the #1 challenge fac-\ning small businesses owners, and nearly 40% of \nthem have job openings that they can’t fill. Pub-\nlic partnerships with trade schools and commu-\nnity colleges can increase the supply of skilled \nlabor. As mentioned in the education section, \nthere are many ways to increase the supply of \nskilled labor.\nInnovative healthcare legislation can reduce \nhealthcare costs and help small businesses \ncompete with larger employers for talent. \nJust like for larger businesses, there is a need for \npredictability in tax policies, litigation processes \nand the EITC – over 15% of small business own-\ners cite these issues as their most pressing \nproblems. Many small businesses face a heavier \nburden from state and local regulations than \nfrom federal ones so seeking best practices \nfrom multiple jurisdictions to streamline require-\nments can support business operations and \ngrowth.\nFinally, we must prepare for the coming “silver \ntsunami” in small business – 75% of business \nowners would like to exit their business in the \nnext decade, representing trillions of dollars in \nbusiness wealth at stake. There will be substan-\ntial turnover in small businesses in the next \ndecade, and we must prepare the next genera-\ntion with the skills and passion to take the baton. \nLocal communities can help protect their tax \nand employment base by investing in succes-\nsion and transition education programs.\nA COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING\n34",

Improper plan-\nning and ineffective execution are rampant, \ncostly and potentially dangerous. Waiting for \nbridges to be near collapse or airports to be \noverly crowded is a bad idea. This planning \ncould include manufacturing sites, maritime, \ngrids, housing, pipelines, canals, broadband and \nhighways, to name but a few. \nWE CAN MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD A \nMORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY.\nTo address the housing supply issue, it is \nimportant to increase funding for effective, \naffordable housing production programs. This \ncan be partially and easily achieved by expand-\ning the already successful Low-Income Housing \nTax Credit programs. Additionally, incentivizing \ninvestments that increase economic opportu-\nnity in disinvested communities is crucial, and \nmaking the New Markets Tax Credit program \npermanent would support this goal. \nIn terms of mortgages, reducing unnecessary \nregulations would decrease homeownership \ncosts. Streamlining loan origination and servic-\ning standards, reducing capital requirements \nand simplifying securitization rules would \nreduce the cost of mortgages without making \nthem riskier. These simple reforms could lower \nthe cost of mortgages by 70–80 basis points. \nThe costs of unnecessary regulation go beyond \nprice - they impact the availability of credit and \nwho can qualify for a mortgage. The Urban Insti-\ntute estimates that a reduction like this would \nincrease mortgage originations by 1 million per \nyear and help lower-income households, in par-\nticular, buy their first home. This would specifi-\ncally help individuals buy homes in the \n$150,000–$300,000 range. Buying a home, still \na pillar of the American Dream, is simply the \nbest way for individuals to start building house-\nhold wealth.\nGood and consistent local zoning requirements \n– that are executed with a sense of urgency – are \nessential in building more affordable housing. \nFinally, the availability of more housing, particu-\nlarly lower-income housing (it’s generally more \neconomical to build denser housing than \ndetached housing), would help people move out \nof rental properties sooner and reduce rents for \nthose who do continue to rent.\nWE CAN STRENGTHEN OUR FINANCIAL \nSYSTEM AND MARKETS. \nWhile we have the best financial system in the \nworld, it can always be improved. And of course, \nour financial system should have good con-\nsumer protections to prevent Americans from \nbeing tempted to purchase bad products or \nbeing misled, as well as strong regulations to \nprotect the country from the failure of financial \ninstitutions. Since the great financial crisis (the \nfinancial system deserved a lot of the negative \nattention it received), we’ve made many \nimprovements to regulations. However, as usual \nin a crisis, we also overreacted. \nFundamentally, we need a dynamic regulatory \nstructure that facilitates growth and innovation \nrather than one that continuously imposes top-\ndown mandates or promotes the constant \ndemonization of corporations and financial ser-\nvices. Shortsighted and misguided policies \noften sound good politically but usually have \nunintended consequences that frequently hurt \nthe very people those policies are trying to help. \nHealthy financial systems are the lifeblood of a \nhealthy economy. You only need to look at many \ncountries around the world to see the damage \ndone to their economy by misguided financial \npolicies and regulations. I’d like to suggest a few \nways we can make our regulatory system better \nfor all Americans. \nWe need to improve bank regulations. \nIt is a completely false narrative that there has \nbeen any type of looser regulation on the largest \nbanks since the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was \npassed.

But even for the regula-\ntors, Dodd-Frank set up a balkanized and dys-\nfunctional regulatory system with too many \ncooks in the kitchen. This is hard for the regula-\ntors as well as the banks – not only does it result \nin excessive and duplicative regulations, but it \nalso makes it more difficult for regulators to be \nresponsive and nimble in a rapidly changing \nenvironment. You might ask why has it taken 10 \nyears to finish Basel III? \nThe enormous rules and regulations by multiple \nregulators that make up the Comprehensive \nCapital and Analysis Review (CCAR) stress test \nand examination are tens of thousands of pages \nlong; our most recent Resolution and Recovery \nplan was 80,000 pages long; and the regula-\ntions around global systemically important \nbanks (G-SIB), liquidity, trading and operational \nrisk have proved to be absurd and even harmful. \nMany of the tests we are required to perform are \nnot even remotely accurate in measuring true \nrisk – and this causes distortions on how and \nwhen capital is allocated and creates large \nopportunities for unnecessary arbitrage.\nThe CCAR stress test, in particular, is highly \nflawed. While it essentially repeats the condi-\ntions during the great financial crisis, it does not \ntake into account any of the structural improve-\nments to regulations, underwriting and product \nofferings since then. The reported results of the \ntest do not come close to anything that would \nactually happen if the hypothetical scenarios \nwere to happen – they unfairly misled the true \nstrength of the banks. The numbers are simply \ninaccurate. It would be far better to perform \naccurate testing, and then if the regulators \nwanted to add conservatism on top of that, they \nshould do so prudently and transparently. I have \nmentioned many times before that we conduct \nhundreds of stress tests a week to protect our-\nselves from a wide range of possible bad out-\ncomes – not just the CCAR scenarios. \nThe supplementary leverage ratio and G-SIB \ncapital rules also treat U.S. Treasury securities \nand repurchase agreements as far riskier than \nthey actually are. And the liquidity coverage \nratio treats all other securities and loans as  \nriskier than they are. These rules effectively dis-\ncourage banks from acting as intermediaries in \nthe financial markets – and this would be partic-\nularly painful at precisely the wrong time: when \nmarkets get volatile. \nSo now is a good time to go back and ask basic \nquestions that should have been asked before \nand, in fact, were required to be asked by legis-\nlation: What is the cost/benefit of these rules, \nand what is the interplay between them?

Account holders can \ndeposit and withdraw funds at any time, and \nthere is no capital gains tax – just an annual tax \nof 1% on the balance. This has dramatically \nincreased investment by retail investors into the \nSwedish stock market. \nThe decline of the defined benefit pension sys-\ntem was fueled by funding rules that can affect \ncash flow and sometimes credit ratings, along \nwith accounting changes for corporate plans \nthat can create huge volatility in a company’s \nearnings and balance sheet. America’s critically \nimportant retirement policy should not have \nbeen undermined by accounting rules. For the \ndefined benefit pension system to remain a via-\nble component of our retirement system, we \nshould return to a model that does not penalize \npension funds for taking some investment risk. \nGuardrails are necessary: We need clear rules \nthat ensure pensions are properly funded and \ntransparent so that participants have confi-\ndence in the system and the burden isn’t trans-\nferred to taxpayers (roughly $70 billion has been \npaid to struggling defined benefit plans under \nthe American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial \nAssistance program). A well-funded pension \nplan offers an investment-supported, tax-advan-\ntaged mechanism for employers to deliver \nretirement benefits cost-effectively. \nWe need to encourage public markets.\nOur public markets have been shrinking dramat-\nically, which I do not believe is a good thing. The \nnumber of public companies has gone from \n7,300 in 1996 to 4,000 today – it should be \n15,000 today. This situation is the result, I \nbelieve, of a combination of factors: costly regu-\nlation and listing requirements; litigation; frivo-\nlous shareholder meetings; interference by \nnon-governmental organizations; irresponsible, \nnot-shareholder-friendly and misguided proxy \nadvisors; lack of research for smaller compa-\nnies; and cookie-cutter compliance require-\nments for boards, among others. \nWe need to improve our retirement system. \nIn 1980, 84% of our country’s private workforce \nhad access to defined benefit plans versus 15% \ntoday. At present, 85% of the private workforce \nhas access to defined contribution plans only, \nmostly 401(k)s. Defined benefit plans give indi-\nviduals a known and guaranteed income that \nsupplements their Social Security benefits, \nwhile employers invest the pension funds’ capi-\ntal to generate long-term returns and manage \nasset-liability risk. \nCurrently, many people are not prepared to deal \nwith self-directed retirement plans, such as \n401(k)s: They don’t necessarily know how to \ninvest the money; and they don’t know how long \nthey will live in retirement. Defined benefit plans \naddress these concerns by transferring the \ninvestment risks and the mortality risk from the \nindividual to the company. \nNonetheless, significant progress has been \nmade to enhance the defined contribution sys-\ntem’s effectiveness for individual savers. Enroll-\nment is now the default option while employer \nmatching has become the norm, and profes-\nsionally managed target date funds offer a sim-\nple age-based model of investing. A young \nworker today will have a much better chance of \nreaching a successful retirement outcome than \nprevious generations. \n401(k) plans still have room for improvement. \nThey should become more cost-effective and \nsimpler to use for both employers and individu-\nals. For example, 401(k)s should be portable \nwhen workers change jobs, and offered in a stan-\ndardized form that can be used by multiple small \nbusinesses. Finally, and this is happening now, \nthese plans should be designed with features that \nmake them more like defined benefit plans. \nWe can learn some valuable lessons from how \nother countries balance adequate contributions, \nprofessional investing, simplified structures and \ntax efficiency. Australia has an excellent retire-\nment system in which employers effectively \ncontribute 12% of ordinary pay into an account \nthat is invested by professionals; the funds are \navailable to the employee upon retirement.

      "text": "III. Specific Issues Facing Our \nCompany\nThe last five years have been a period of signifi-\ncant growth for us – as evidence, we added \nmore than 60,000 people to our workforce. \nWhile we have been very successful during this \ntime, which was complicated by the pandemic, \nwe allowed some bad habits to develop. Working \nfrom home exacerbated the situation by hinder-\ning innovation, slowing decision making, inhibit-\ning information sharing, reducing efficiency, and \ncreating more politics and bureaucracy. In the \nnext section, Management Learnings, and in the \nletter by our Chief Operating Officer, we talk \nabout various ways we seek to keep our com-\npany healthy and some specific efforts we are \nmaking to maintain our grit, our edge and our \nefficiency – all while keeping a keen sense that \nour competition around the world is always gain-\ning. Here I outline how we are dealing with par-\nticular business challenges. \nWE TAKE A LONG VIEW IN DEALING \nWITH OUR EXCESS CAPITAL. \nDepending on what happens with all future reg-\nulations, we have somewhere between $30 bil-\nlion to $60 billion in excess capital. While this is \na nice problem to have, it does require some \nexplanation on how we plan to deal with it. We \naim to maintain a very secure dividend of 30% to \n35% of current earnings. When it comes to capi-\ntal deployment, our first priority has always been \nto invest in organic growth – as growth with \ngood returns is the greatest value driver. Our \nsecond priority would be to use that capital for \nacquisitions, but, for a variety of reasons, we find \nit hard to imagine a sufficiently compelling \nlarge-scale acquisition at this time. Our last pri-\nority would be to buy back stock. We believe \nthat buying back stock should benefit ongoing \nshareholders rather than simply returning cash \nto exiting shareholders. Therefore, buying back \nstock, which might be a no-brainer at one times \ntangible book value, becomes a stretch above \ntwo times the tangible book value. This explains \nwhy our stock buyback program has not used \nup all of our capital generation and why our \nequity capital has grown. We are very patient, \nand don’t believe that there is any magic to the \nnext 12 months, and, therefore, we look at \nexcess capital as earnings in store or reserve – \nwaiting to be used.\nAfter reading the first section of this letter about \nthe state of the world and the many risks facing \nthe global economy, we hope you can see why \nwe also believe that now is a good time to retain \nlots of extra capital and liquidity. \nWE BRING AN INVESTOR/OWNER \nMINDSET TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.\nWe are very fortunate to be able to drive organic \ngrowth in virtually every part of our company – \nand at healthy returns. Organic growth is hard, \nbut it’s the best way to drive long-term, sustained \nshareholder value. You can read about many of \nthese initiatives in the CEO letters of this Annual \nReport. Suffice it to say, organic growth involves \nadding bankers, branches, technology, products, \nservices and countries virtually everywhere (we \nopened two new branch offices in Africa this year: \nin Kenya and Côte d’Ivoire). I had the privilege of \nvisiting Kenya in 2024 with two of our senior \nexecutives who grew up there – it was quite mov-\ning to meet their families – both to see how \nimportant it is for Kenya to have JPMorganChase \nin their country and to see the great American \nstory of how America can attract, train and \ndevelop great talent. You couldn’t help but be \nmoved to see the pride on the mothers’ faces for \ntheir son’s and daughter’s achievements and the \ntears of joy in their eyes. \nThe CEO letters cover our new affluent client \ndrive following the acquisition of First Republic, \nnew payment systems, enhanced development \nfinance efforts, private credit and our huge new \nefforts around the growing Innovation Economy. \nOur great economies of scale allow us to invest \nand compete – with much of our growth driven \nby technology builds of new products and ser-\nvices.

We \nneed to be as nimble as they are and use our \nskills and capabilities to stay ahead. \nOUR LARGEST RISK IS GEOPOLITICAL \nRISK. \nYou have already read about the high and grow-\ning geopolitical and global economic risks. We \nconstantly evaluate various potential outcomes \n(tabletop exercises) to ensure we can handle a \nrange of scenarios. One of the largest risks we \nface is cyber attacks, both directly on our bank \nand on critical infrastructure; e.g., energy, com-\nmunications. We also look at other potential \nlarge risks, such as war, hybrid and cyber war-\nfare, energy disruptions and ongoing global \nthreats, among other dangers. When we look at \nthese various scenarios, we try to analyze and \nmake sure we can handle not just the immediate \neffects on our company but also the secondary \nand tertiary impacts: effects on clients and \npotential dramatic repercussions on markets \nand the global economy. While we are not pre-\ndicting or even expecting some of these terrible \nevents, we believe that it is our job to be a source \nof strength, particularly in the toughest of times. \nWE’RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE: \nECONOMY, INFLATION, INTEREST \nRATES, ASSET PRICES, TRADE WARS, \nOH MY!\nThe United States has had a rather healthy  \nand steady economy for years, although it  \nwas already weakening as I began writing this \nletter – and that was before the recent tariff \nannouncement\nThe economy is facing considerable turbulence \n(including geopolitics), with the potential posi-\ntives of tax reform and deregulation and the \npotential negatives of tariffs and “trade wars,” \nongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and \nstill rather high asset prices and volatility. \nBefore I get into some of these issues, there is  \na really big “BUT” about what is considered \nAmerica’s exceptional economic performance: \nPart of this performance has been driven by \nextraordinary deficit spending and the quantita-\ntive easing that took place. Since COVID-19, the \nfederal government has borrowed and spent \nalmost $11 trillion, and the Federal Reserve \nbought over $4.5 trillion in securities, creating \nhuge liquidity in the financial system. Some of \nthe results are exactly what you would expect: \nstrong growth, inflation and higher corporate \nprofits due to all the spending. But the U.S. defi-\ncit remains very large at just below $2 trillion, or \n6.6% of GDP, which is the highest peacetime \nlevel ever not driven by recessionary needs (as, \nfor example, during the pandemic). This high \nU.S. deficit also is associated with large trade \ndeficits and is happening while our debt-to- \nGDP ratio is already over 100%, which is another \npeacetime high. The rest of the world has ele-\nvated debt levels and high fiscal deficits as well, \nalthough few as large as those of the United \nStates. These large deficits are not sustainable \n– I do not know whether it will cause a real prob-\nlem in six months or six years – the sooner we \ndeal with it, the better. \nTariffs and non-tariff barriers have always been \nhotly contested in trade negotiation. Non-tariff \nbarriers come in many forms and have been \ngrowing over time (regulatory barriers, govern-\nment procurement, export subsidies, food \nrestrictions, etc.). Recently, value-added taxes \n(VAT) have entered this debate. Economists \ngenerally see VATs as a tax on domestic expen-\nditures that does not discriminate on the source \nof spending. But since the VAT does not tax \nexports, some see them as a non-tariff trade \nbarrier. In any event, their effect on trade may \nnot be very large. \nWhatever you think of the legitimate reasons for \nthe newly announced tariffs – and, of course, \nthere are some – or the long-term effect, good \nor bad, there are likely to be important short-\nterm effects. As for the short-term, we are likely \nto see inflationary outcomes, not only on \nimported goods but on domestic prices, as \ninput costs rise and demand increases on \ndomestic products. How this plays out on differ-\nent products will partially depend on their sub-\nstitutability and price elasticity. Whether or not \nthe menu of tariffs causes a recession remains \nin question, but it will slow down growth. \nSPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\n41",

      "text": "There are many uncertainties surrounding the \nnew tariff policy: the potential retaliatory \nactions, including on services, by other coun-\ntries, the effect on confidence, the impact on \ninvestments and capital flows, the effect on  \ncorporate profits and the possible effect on the \nU.S. dollar. The quicker this issue is resolved,  \nthe better because some of the negative effects \nincrease cumulatively over time and would be \nhard to reverse. In the short run, I see this as one \nlarge additional straw on the camel’s back.\nI am hoping that after negotiations, the long-\nterm effect will have some positive benefits for \nthe United States. My most serious concern is \nhow this will affect America’s long-term eco-\nnomic alliances, as I have written about in the \nfirst section. \nOur economy also faces the unknown effects of \nquantitative tightening – you must remember we \nhave never had this much quantitative easing \nand, therefore, quantitative tightening before. \nThis introduces another element of uncertainty, \nwhich, in my view – particularly in conjunction \nwith the restrictions put on market making by  \nprimary dealers – will likely lead to much higher  \nvolatility in the treasury markets. This higher vol-\natility is not necessarily bad for JPMorganChase, \nbut it is not particularly good for the capital  \nmarkets. Fortunately, there are many regulatory \nchanges now being discussed that could amelio-\nrate the situation. \nWhile inflation has come down, most of what I \nsee in the future is inflationary: continued high \nfiscal deficits, the remilitarization of the world \nand the need for infrastructure investment, \nincluding the green economy and the restruc-\nturing of trade and tariffs. \nAnother critical point: All these factors will \nimpact interest rates. While the Federal Reserve \nessentially controls short-term interest rates, it \ndoes not effectively control 10-year interest \nrates. The Fed can take actions that can affect \nthe 10-year interest rate in the short run, but, \nultimately, the 10-year rate will be based upon \ninflation, the strength of the U.S. economy and \nexpectations of the future value of the dollar, and \nthe supply and global demand for long-term \ntreasuries. All things being equal, the slower the \ngrowth, the lower the interest rates, and the \nhigher the inflation, the higher the interest rates. \nThis tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it’s \ngood to remember that in the stagflation of the \n1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable \ntrend of rising rates. While interest rates have \ncome down recently due to the weakening dol-\nlar, the risk off trade and the prospect of slower \ngrowth, this trend could still reverse. \nMoreover, it is worth noting that we enter this \ntime of uncertainty with high equity and debt \nprices, even after the recent decline. No matter \nhow you measure it, equity valuations are still \nwell above their historical averages. And credit \nspreads are still near the low end of these same \nranges. Markets still seem to be pricing assets \nwith the assumption that we will continue to \nhave a fairly soft landing. I am not so sure.\nAll of these cross currents and turbulence may \ntake years to play out. It is almost impossible to \nconfidently put them into a quarterly or even \nannual forecast. We always hope for the best, \nbut we are prepared for a full range of outcomes \n– lower or higher rates and potentially lower \nasset prices, all of which could be driven by  \ndifferent factors, including inflation, recession, \nhigh capital demand, successful trade negotia-\ntions, regulatory and/or tax reform, or adverse \neffects from ongoing wars. Even with fairly \nextreme outcomes, our company would remain \nhealthy.\nFinally, I would like to close this section by reiter-\nating that I still have an abiding faith in America \n– the exceptional strength of our innovative \neconomy and our resiliency.\nCONSUMER PAYMENTS HAVE BECOME \nA NEW BATTLEGROUND.\nThere is a lot of misunderstanding about the \nvalue and cost of a consumer checking account. \nOur consumer bank serves nearly 44 million \ncustomers and just over 60 million accounts. It \ncosts approximately $225 for us to maintain an \naccount, of which roughly $150 is a fixed \nexpense. Included among these costs are all the \nbranch expenses, the people expenses and the \ncost of onboarding accounts (including verifying \ncustomers’ identity and meeting Know Your \nCustomer and anti-money laundering require-\nments). They do not include certain litigation \ncosts or the cost of capital, which would add \nanother $1.5 billion or essentially $25 per \naccount.

However, for accounts with \nlower balances, which make up the majority of \naccounts, this is generally around $25 a year. \nBanks also receive certain fees, such as monthly \naccount fees, overdraft fees and debit card fees, \nwhich on these accounts is usually around $100 \na year. For these lower balance accounts, our \ncosts to maintain and operate them are far \ngreater than what we make from them.\nDebit revenue, which is paid by the third party \nreceiving the payment rather than the con-\nsumer, was cut in half due to the ill-conceived \nDurbin Amendment (the average revenues from \ndebit went from approximately $130 to $60 – \nthis had been a large share of the revenues from \nsmaller accounts). In setting the pricing for debit \ncards, the government looked only at the cost  \nof the debit card swipe, which is illogical as that \nassumes a debit card is a separate and distinct \nproduct from its underlying checking account. \nDebit cards are a feature of the checking \naccount that enable consumers to access their \nfunds to pay merchants. Therefore, the true cost \nof providing debit cards should also include the \ncosts associated with operating checking \naccounts (e.g., the costs of branches, bankers \nand so on). Predictably, to make up for their lost \nrevenue, banks had to increase their fee sched-\nules, causing approximately 1 million more indi-\nviduals to become unbanked. The Durbin \nAmendment is the only case I can think of where \nthe government determined the pricing between \ntwo big industries, in this case banks and \nretailers. \nRetailers now pay banks like ours that are sub-\nject to this government-mandated pricing 47 \nbasis points (0.47%), on average, for debit card \ntransactions. This is far cheaper for retailers \nthan debit card alternatives, such as cash and \nchecks, while debit cards also provide retailers \nimmediate guaranteed money and are preferred \nby consumers. All retailers bear a high cost of \nprocessing cash (including defalcation, cash \nsorting, delivery of cash to a bank, counterfeit \nfunds and higher insurance because of robber-\nies). The cost of processing cash, even for the \nlargest retailers, is probably more than 4% of the \npayment. It is unfortunate that retailers and \nbanks have been in a battle for years over who \nshould bear the cost of processing money – and \nthat retailers continue to use “lawfare” to get \ntheir way. This also makes it ironic that retailers \nare now adding “buy now-pay later” features as \nanother payment option for their customers, \nwhich usually cost the retailer considerably \nmore than processing a debit or even credit card \ntransaction. \nOur Consumer Bank lost $500 million from fraud \nlast year – $300 million from losses as a result of \ncustomer fraud committed on us (for example, \ncounterfeit deposited checks) and $200 million \nfrom reimbursements to customers who were \nvictims of fraud (it is our policy to reimburse \n100% of valid fraud claims). Unfortunately, we \nmust also process thousands of scam claims \nwhere customers authorized transactions but \nshould not have done so (for example, buying \nnonexistent products or sending money to fake \nwebsites), often because they were misled by \nbad actors. The loss rate to scams for our cus-\ntomers is amongst the lowest in the industry, \nand lower than nonbank payment providers. \nThat is because we have made significant \ninvestments in fraud and scam detection, as well \nas prevention capabilities, and believe that our \nefforts have prevented Chase customers from \nlosing $12 billion. Fraud and scams are a societal \nproblem, and we need law enforcement, retail-\ners, social media, telecom companies and oth-\ners to work together to stop these crimes at the \nsource. \nNow a new battle is brewing: Third parties want \nfull access to banks’ customer data so they  \ncan exploit it for their own purposes and profits. \nContrary to what you may read, we have no \nproblem with data sharing but only if it is done \nproperly: It must be authorized by the customer \n– the customer should know exactly what data is \nshared and when and how it is used; third par-\nties should pay for accessing the banking sys-\ntem and payment rails; third parties should be \nrestricted from using the customers’ data for \nSPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY\n43",

Importantly, the Institute has also \nhelped shape some of our own products and \nemployee benefits, including how we incentiv-\nize customers to save more money and \nreduce health insurance deductibles for our \nlower-paid employees.\n•\t JPMorganChase PolicyCenter. Five years \nago, we launched the JPMorganChase Policy-\nCenter to distill what we’ve learned through \nthe firm’s business resources and expertise, \nincluding Institute research and data, talent \nand philanthropic investments, into action-\nable, evidence-based policy recommenda-\ntions.

Leadership \nshould always be about learning and question-\ning. Our company needs to nurture innovation, \nambition and discipline while discouraging com-\nplacency, arrogance and bureaucracy. Here is a \nslightly streamlined (I did speak for 90 minutes) \nand edited version (to protect clients, former \ncolleagues … and myself!) of my actual remarks \nto our team:\nWelcome, everybody. I have a lot to say, and I’ve \ntried to organize it thoughtfully and intelligently. \nI just want to start with: What a great company!  \nI don’t know about you, but when I see this com-\npany in action, it just blows me away. The quality \nof the people, the respect of our clients, and how \nmuch they want us in cities and countries around \nthe world – it’s extraordinary. That’s based on the \nthings that you do and how you do them.\nWHY COMPLACENCY, ARROGANCE, \nBUREAUCRACY AND BS KILL \nCOMPANIES. \nPart of what I’m always asking is: How do we \nmake sure we stay innovative, ambitious and \ndisciplined while eliminating complacency,  \narrogance and bureaucracy? \nSo let’s look at a bunch of things. None of this is \nout of anger; it’s just thoughtful consideration \nabout reinforcing some basic disciplines. \nYou know, if you already have 100 people on \nyour team, can you live with 100 people – or \nfewer – and make that work? This is very import-\nant. Everyone in this room, I’m talking to you per-\nsonally. When I give examples, don’t say that \napplies to someone else: “That’s not my unit. \nThat doesn’t affect me.”\nIV. Management Learnings\nIt does, and I’m going to tell you why. Because all \nof you are responsible for this company that’s \nworth around $700 billion, employs 320,000 \npeople and serves so many, including all the cli-\nents you’ve seen who depend on you around the \nworld. You, individually, are responsible. And you \nknow more than you think. When you travel \naround, when you talk to people and when you \nmanage what you do means that you know more \nthan you think.\nAs you know, we’ve been asking people to \nachieve a 10% efficiency target. Again, it’s a dis-\ncipline in business. Think about what you your-\nself can do to make things better. This is basic \nbusiness: Can you do more with less? What are \nyour units doing that can be streamlined? Or \nmaybe you are doing things you don’t need to  \nbe doing at all.\nI apologize, when I’m being specific, if it’s you I’m \ntalking about. I’ve just got to get some things off \nmy chest about what we need to do and some of \nthe things I’ve seen recently or over my career. \nI’m going to ask each and every one of you,  \npersonally – and I’m going to track it – to send \nme an email. We’re going to have a little team to \ntake these issues you raise and follow up, and \nthis will be permanent. I kind of like bureaucracy \nbusting to get things done. It could be stupid \nthings you’ve observed, any ideas, almost any-\nthing. We’re not trying to limit you to any specific \ncategory.\nYou’ve got something to say? You want to add \nsomething? You want to check out something? \nYou think something doesn’t make sense? \nPlease bring it up. Too many people stay in their \nlane. I’m going to follow up personally with each \nand every one of you in this room. I’m just asking \nyou to sit down and have a little fun thinking \nabout the stupid stuff we do, the bureaucratic \nstuff we do – about things you would change if \nyou were able to change them – and you all can \nbe very helpful. I think we should all be thinking \nabout this.\nMANAGEMENT LEARNINGS\n48",

And I’ve written down \nsome examples of winners and losers from just \nthe last 20 or 30 years that didn’t adapt. \nSears and Kmart, they’re gone. Digital Equip-\nment: Gone. A&P, the best supermarket in the \nworld, disappeared – overtaken by Kroger. Black-\nBerry practically disappeared, too. Walmart’s \ndone well. Dell did well, Apple obviously has done \nwell, and Amazon has done well. Remember \nwhen everyone used to have Nokia phones? \nIt’s even worse in financial services, where  \ncompanies can manipulate numbers and over- \nleverage and stuff like that. Travelers blew up, \nCiti blew up twice. Bear Stearns failed. Lehman \nfailed. And Bank One – I’m here because, you \nknow, Bank One screwed up a bunch of busi-\nnesses. The S&L business – the whole business \n– got wiped out. The whole thing. Savings and \nloans do not exist anymore. WaMu’s mortgage \nlosses. Whole parts of the mortgage business \ndisappeared, and mortgage brokers disap-\npeared. Kidder disappeared. Drexel disappeared. \nAnd then more recently, Silicon Valley Bank’s \ninterest rate mismatch.\nOf those that failed, many failed out of compla-\ncency, and complacency is a form of bureau-\ncracy. It’s arrogance – it’s being slow to adjust. \nComplacency allows a lot of negative things to \nset in: dishonest numbers, failure to set stan-\ndards, bad people, bad compensation schemes, \ndisincentives, bad incentives, politics – and \nthese things are all the cancers that kill compa-\nnies. We all have to be very cautious when we \nsee this happening. \nAnd things are faster and more complex now. \nThat means we’ve got to move quicker, coordi-\nnate better and do things at a faster speed.\nYOU HAVE TO GET THE NUMBERS \nRIGHT.\nI’m a fanatic about proper accounting. Account-\ning can lead you to the wrong answer. Regula-\ntory rules can lead you to the wrong answer. \nRegulatory capital can lead you to the wrong \nanswer. Or your own echo chamber can steer \nyou the wrong way. Still, you need to know your \nnumbers: You need to get your numbers right, \nunderstand them, analyze them, work them, test \nthem and don’t be rote about it. \nMcKinsey used strategic business units as a \nway of segmenting businesses. Always remem-\nber that when you have big companies, it’s \nimportant to break them down to look at the \ncomponent parts because the game is fought \nin the specific units. It’s fought in commercial \ncard. It’s fought in premier card. It’s fought in \nbranch banking. It’s fought in small business. \nHowever, it’s not fought in the consumer fran-\nchise as a whole.\nYou must have an actual budget as your \nbarometer. For example, you can’t always com-\npare yourself with the forecast because then \nyou’re always very close. You’ve got to show \nany deficits or progress against the budget. \nAnother thing I hate is comparing yourself with \nthe peer average. I mean, really? You should \nalways compare yourself with the best. Where \nare they, and where are we? Remember that the \npeer average includes some really crummy \ncompanies, too. \nYou have to – we have to – always understand \nthat a rigorous review of allocated expenses is \nneeded. They are real expenses, but you have \nthe right to question them. You have to ques-\ntion them because seeing through the BS that \ngets involved in allocating expenses – and then \ncauses misallocation of capital – is really \ncritical. \nZero-based budgeting. I don’t like asking peo-\nple to do it. It’s too hard. But you’ve got to think \nthat way. For instance, if I start with 100 people \ndoing the same thing, what do I do differently, \nbetter, more with the same number of people? \nUnderstand that a P&L is not an assessment of \na business – you’ve got to do the full assess-\nment with customer metrics, turnover, apps, \ntechnology ... whatever matters. In fact, the P&L \ncould be the most deceptive thing of all – tell-\ning you and giving the wrong answer.\nProject reporting. Whenever you have a proj-\nect, and this is on you, it’s important to do \nproper reporting. It could be technology cost,  \nit could be anything. I remember coming to  \nJ.P. Morgan and, one after another, every proj-\nect was on course – but from the last forecast.  \nI said, “Show me where it is from the begin-\nning,” and now every single project was a year \nor two late.

External reporting actually \nmatters. So I’m always quite careful. Reporting \nexternally is real, but for a lot of companies, it’s \nnot – they sugarcoat, they make it obscure. And \nwhat happens inside those companies is people \nstart running their businesses that way. You’ve \nnever seen me spin analysts. That’s because if  \nI spin analysts, you’re going to spin me. That’s it. \nYou know, I want to honestly show how we com-\npare with competitors. \nHonest analysis. In your financial analysis, \nalways evaluate the good, the bad, the ugly. That \nwill make you better. Doing just the good makes \nyou worse. Doing the good, the bad and the ugly \nmakes you get better versus the competition. \nConstant investment. You know, the practice of \nstop-starting investments is a bad idea. Constant \ntransformation in technology and conversions \nmeans you can’t have stop-start strategies \nalmost anywhere. Make proper assumptions: \nWhat do you do when your spread on deposits is \nzero, but you’re still opening branches? That’s \nwhy I always talk about “through-the-cycle” \ninvestments. Think very carefully about the \nassumptions that go into your budgets because, \nsometimes, they cause you to do stupid stuff, and \nsometimes they stop you from doing good stuff.\nWatching competitors. This involves comparing \nyourself with what the competition is doing \ntoday. But you always need to show how you’re \ngoing to catch up to where things might go. \nYou’ve got to say, “What are the competitors \ngoing to do next?” because that shows when \nyou’re getting to the puck and where the puck is \ngoing to be – not where things currently stand. \nGood expenses/bad revenue. Sometimes great \nexpenses become great investments. The fact \nthat it’s something called an expense means \nnothing to me. In fact, a lot of businesses capi-\ntalize these expenses. You build a plant, you \ncapitalize it. You don’t start expensing it until it’s \nproducing. But when we open a branch, many of \nthe costs are not capitalized. We have a large \ncash outflow to build it, but after approximately \nfour years when it breaks even, it generates \nprofit for eternity. This is also true for private \nbankers, investment bankers, Chase wealth \nmanagers – our investment in them pays off \nover time.\nIn all that we do to grow and innovate, we must \ndo the full analysis – as I’ve said, “the good, the \nbad, the ugly.” This makes us better. Looking at \nonly the positives is dangerous. We all know \nthere are good revenues and bad revenues, \ngood expenses and bad expenses. We can make \na big loan and book lots of revenue in the short \nterm, but those will turn out to be bad revenues \nif we didn’t do the proper analysis at the begin-\nning. The same reasoning applies to expenses.  \nI hate the concept of cutting costs; instead, the \nconcept should always be cutting waste. If costs \nare investments that drive healthy growth, then  \nI want more of them.\nExpense allocations. I’ve got a heritage JPMor-\nganChase example. The company used to be \ndominated by the investment bank – because \nthe people on the executive floor cared mostly \nabout the investment bank. Everything was \nskewed toward the investment bank. They took \nHR costs, including pension, medical, executive \ncomp, expats – all these costs lumped together \n– and they charged them out based on head-\ncount across the company, which was not accu-\nrate. Expats were 100% in the investment bank. \nExecutive comp was 100% in the investment \nbank, but their expenses were spread across the \nwhole company. We subsidized capital for the \ntrading floors. In all, subsidizing the investment \nbank cost $2 billion a year, which I immediately \nfixed. This was not to punish anyone, but it was a \nhuge misallocation of capital. The big loser in all \nthis was the consumer bank, and I’m still quite \nsensitive about that. \nHere’s another example: Capacity in the com-\nputer center was charged out to everybody, \nwhereas the extra capacity, which is quite \nexpensive, was required for only certain busi-\nnesses but not others. It is not a waste of time to \nget expense allocation right. You may spend no \ntime on it, but you shouldn’t be paying for capac-\nity. We need payment systems to be paid for by \nthe payment businesses. It’s important to be \nvigilant when you analyze expenses because \nthings always morph, always go bad. Don’t \nassume allocations are okay. Businesses some-\ntimes get credit for things they shouldn’t get \npaid for, and they don’t mention it.\nMANAGEMENT LEARNINGS\n50",

      "text": "I’ll just give you another example. When I got to \nJPMorganChase, we paid the treasury sales-\nforce based on estimated revenue going for-\nward. That was it. And almost no adjustments \nlater on. It was staggering. \nInvesting in branches. When I became CEO, \nBank One hadn’t opened a branch in five years. \nChase hadn’t opened a branch in five years. \nChase had barely refurbished its branches, but \nat least Bank One did. By the time we did the \nmerger, Bank One was making $1 million-plus \nprofit on each branch every year: 2,300 \nbranches. Chase was making zero, partially \nbecause of its allocation practices and partially \nbecause no one seemed to care about them.\nBut these branches should have been hugely \nprofitable. We don’t give a branch credit for \ncredit cards when they create a credit card \naccount that’s worth $600, even though \nbranches create 1.5 million credit card accounts \na year. That’s $900 million of value.\nWe do this NPV (net present value) analysis \nabout why we should close a branch, and we \nshould do this. We should be disciplined. I think, \nfor the most part, NPVs might work, but they \ndon’t always work. You need to use your com-\nmon sense.\nSometimes banks will say they’re going to close \na branch because it’s kind of small. This hap-\npened to me recently with our Old Greenwich \nbranch. They were going to close it, and I just \nlooked at some of the numbers ... and I went \nnumb. It was making approximately $500,000, \nall profit, the NPV. And it’s six miles to the next \nclosest branch. I said, if you close that branch, \nyou know what’s going to happen? Eighty per-\ncent of the revenues will move elsewhere – to the \nWells Fargo down the street, along with most of \nthe local small businesses. Now would you rather \nhave $500,000 a year profit or $1 million in cash \nin your pocket? I’d rather keep the $500,000 \nannually. Who’s going to open in the same spot? \nOne of our competitors: Wells Fargo, Bank of \nAmerica or Citizens. And why does someone \nwant to drive six miles in the winter on those icy \nroads? And is the branch more profitable than it \nlooks? And to me, this wasn’t thinking about the \nNPV; it was the pawn blocking the queen. \nJudgment calls. Well, while we’re talking about \ncutting costs, I also did something unusual in \n2008: I opened the partners’ dining room. This is \njust how I think about what you should do, and \nwhat you shouldn’t do. You do the right thing \nanyway, whether it looks good or bad. The whole \nOperating Committee said, “Don’t do it. The \npartners’ dining room is going to cost a lot, and \nit will look like we are spoiling ourselves with \ngood food.” And I was like, “Yeah, but we don’t \nactually know each other after the merger – and \nif we don’t do it now, it’ll be years before we get \nto know each other.” I call it a good expense. It’s \na judgment call. You do the right thing and then \nexplain it. Sometimes people don’t do things \nbecause they think it’ll look bad for them or hurt \nmorale a little bit. When I got to Bank One, I \nauthorized a partners’ dining room, and I did this \nat J.P. Morgan, too. \nYOU NEED A FULL AND CONSTANT \nASSESSMENT. \nWe can learn so much from our competitors, \ncustomers and employees if we only open our \neyes and ears. I want a full and constant assess-\nment of our competition, including many organi-\nzations outside of financial services. We always \nneed to look and learn, assess and evaluate – \nstringently monitoring market trends and \nengaging with whoever does something better \nthan us. Visit other companies, see their \nbranches. Go on road trips with your people. \nTake your management teams to dinner. When \nyou talk with clients and they tell you that you’re \nmaking a mistake, thank them. It’s a gift. And if \nthe issue is not in your area, write it down and \nsend it to the person who’s responsible. Get out \nof your own echo chamber. Hit the road, leave \nyour office and talk with everyone you can – be \nconstantly learning and assessing. Don’t be \nafraid to admit if you’ve made a mistake or were \nlate to the game on something. It’s okay to be a \nfast follower. Just do a postmortem and identify \nwhat you’d do differently next time.\nI mentioned learning from those outside our \nindustry. Take Chick-fil-A as an example. I read \nthey’re using drones to figure out how to move \npeople through the drive-thru line faster. We \nshould always have that mindset of making \nsomething easier for our customers. \nMANAGEMENT LEARNINGS\n51",

      "text": "Ten years ago I said, “I’d like our senior team \nfrom the consumer bank to go to China.” I wish \nI had done more things like that sooner. This \ngoes back to why it’s important to get on the \nroad – to really understand your business and \nthe competition. The team didn’t really want to \ngo, but they did go, and they got to see Alib-\naba, Ping An and Tencent in action. And it \nchanged the way they thought about digital \nbanking, biometrics, super apps and other \ntechnology advancements. It’s amazing what \nyou learn on the road. \nYOU BETTER HAVE GREAT \nCONTROLS. \nHonest numbers are critical to having great \ncontrols. Make a practice of continually \nreviewing financial operational detail, project \nreporting and audit reports. It’s a discipline \nlike exercising – it should be frequent and rig-\norous. And little things can add up to big \nthings. \nBack in the Primerica days, I bought one of \nthose big Xerox copy machines for 2 million \nbucks. I’m down in Primerica’s printing plant, \nand the guy there showed me his Xerox copy \nmachine, and I said, “Great, I just bought one \nof these.” He asked, “How much did you pay \nfor it?” I said, “Two million dollars. How much \ndid you pay?” He said, “Fifty thousand dollars.” \nYou know why? He bought it from a bankrupt \ncompany. It was still in the box. That’s all. Let’s \ndo that a little bit every now and then. \nAdditionally, in terms of risk management, \nalways examine new products and new credit \nunderwriting standards. New products often \ntend to blow up. That happened with foreign \nexchange, with mortgage-backed securities, \nwith swaps, derivatives, credit default swaps \nand others. Often, these new products have \nnot been fully tested and haven’t been used \nover a long enough period of time. I’m also a \nfanatic about stress testing, which they \nquickly learned at J.P. Morgan when I first got \nthere. In their scenarios, they were looking at \nequity markets down 10% and credit spreads \ngapping out 40%. Was that sufficient? No!  \nI said let’s look at what would happen if equity \nmarkets were down 50%, high yield went to \n20% and credit spreads gapped out to the \nworst ever. That is real stress testing and risk \nmanagement. \nYOU MUST KILL BUREAUCRACY ALL \nTHE TIME AND RELENTLESSLY.\nOne of the biggest things that can kill a company \n– or make it slow to adjust or admit problems – is \nbureaucracy. It comes in a lot of forms, and you \nhave to continuously weed that garden. It’s a \nmindset.\nTake Home Depot: When you walk into the Home \nDepot global galactic headquarters, the sign \nabove the main entrance says “Store Support \nCenter.” It reminds corporate employees every \nday that they are there because they support the \nworkers in stores around the country. And we \nhave to remember – all of us, particularly corpo-\nrate staff – that we are here because we have a \ncustomer, a branch or an investment banker in \nfront of a client. That is an important mindset. \nThen you can use things like war rooms and \nreview customer complaints to hone this \nthinking.\nI always like to read customer complaints. I read \nthem, and when I know the policy behind the \ncomplaint, I call up the people in charge and say, \n“I agree with the customer.” Sure, we “shoulda, \ncoulda, woulda.” But I don’t give a damn whether \nwe’re technically responsible or not. You’ve got \nto do the right thing; you’ve got to change your \nmindset.\nLet’s take ATMs. When I got to Bank One, this \nsituation happened. My wife called me from Wal-\ngreens. The Bank One ATM didn’t work. I tell the \npeople on the ATM side of the bank, and a guy \ncalls me back and says, “No, it’s working.” I say, \n“My wife called me and says it’s not working.” He \nreplies, “No, it’s working.” So I say, “Do me a \nfavor – get in your car and drive out there.” Then \nhe drives out there – and it’s not working. As it \nturned out, we had an outside vendor tracking \nthis stuff. So I told the guy that we were firing the \nvendor and wouldn’t pay him for the last six \nmonths. Now we track it ourselves. This stuff \ncan happen all the time.\nThen there’s the black car story. You all know the \nblack car story never happened at J.P. Morgan. It \ndid happen when we took over Shearson though. \nI was going outside one day, and there were, lit-\nerally, 50 black cars. People were waiting to go \nhome until 7 o’clock so they could take a black \ncar home. They were supposed to take them to \nthe closest train station.

I went back to her boss, \nwho knew about it. And I said to the boss, “You \nknow, I can get her a full-time car and driver for \none-third the cost.” And I changed a bunch of \nrules and stuff like that.\nSome years ago, all our branches were receiving \ntons of stuff, daily and weekly, from Corporate – \nfrom HR, Risk, Legal, Compliance, Trading, \nAudit, Finance – they were overwhelmed. I used \nto go to branches, and they’d complain about \nthings they didn’t know about. I said, “We sent \nyou a memo that was full of information.” And \none of the men in the branch showed me a \nFedEx box, the really big one, and dropped it in \nfront of me. He said, “This box is what we get \nevery week from you guys.” He had no idea \nabout all the stuff that was in it. So we just \nchanged things up a bit, using common sense, \nand created a little booklet called, I think, “Since \nWe Last Met” or “You Must Read This.” It had a \nsummary page and listed the important stuff \npeople needed to know. Little things like this are \nimportant to get right.\nIt’s important for leadership to always question \nwhat their company does and why. And the \nanswer cannot be, “That’s the way we’ve always \ndone it.” Lots of times bad habits form and  \npeople get lazy, take shortcuts or don’t care \nenough. A good example is from when I came \nto JPMorganChase more than 20 years ago.  \nI was told we had 500 management coaches.  \nI said, “Five hundred coaches? Really?” Our \nOperating Committee was slightly annoyed by \nmy question and wondered whether I was going \nto micromanage every single decision. Of \ncourse I said that I wasn’t – and that it was their \ndecision – but the issue really bothered me. I \nthought about it over the weekend, and on \nMonday I told the Operating Committee, “You \nknow what? I changed my mind. I’m going to \nmicromanage this one. I want all coaches out \nby the end of the week.” I didn’t take that step \nto save money. I did it because it’s a leader’s job \nto coach, and we basically had outsourced \nmanagement! I told the committee they could \nbring back a coach at the end of one year if  \nthey truly thought it was necessary and if they \npersonally vouched for the coach’s capabilities. \nBut in my entire career, I’ve rarely seen this kind \nof outsourcing of responsibility succeed. \nHere’s another example of what slows us down: \nmeetings. Kill meetings. But when they do hap-\npen, they have to start on time and end on time \n– and someone’s got to lead them. There should \nalso be a purpose to every meeting and always a \nfollow-up list. Sometimes we think we’re just \nbeing nice by inviting people to a meeting who \ndon’t have to be there. Sometimes we overcol-\nlaborate. One annoying example of bureaucracy \nis the meeting after the meeting, where an exec-\nutive tells me what they didn’t want to say in \nfront of their partners. That’s not acceptable. \nDon’t bother. I’m not their messenger. Lay it on \nthe table in real time. Shine light on a problem or \ndisagreement. Be transparent with your col-\nleagues. Obviously, it’s different if it involves a \nprivate matter, but, usually, this strategy is just a \ngo-around, an end run. We cannot allow these \nkinds of behaviors.\nMISTAKES I MADE.\nI also recognize that I don’t always get everything \nright and that I have made plenty of mistakes \nmyself, and that’s why I want to candidly share \nsome of them – as lessons. It’s important that we \nall do that. For example, I underestimated the \nimportance of cloud technology, I’ve sometimes \nleft the wrong person in a job for too long and I \nfailed to recognize some early signs of risk. \nIn sharing these experiences, I always reflect on \nthe anatomy of mistakes and emphasize the \nneed to acknowledge and learn from them.  \nMistakes happened for a variety of reasons –  \nwe didn’t have the right people in the room, we \ndidn’t work hard enough, we didn’t have a \nthoughtful decision-making process, we didn’t \nget the right inputs, we made bad assumptions. \nThe London Whale, where we lost billions of  \ndollars in 2012, is another mistake that’s good  \nto reflect upon. The mistake there wasn’t the \ncomplexity of the portfolio; it was that it didn’t \nget the proper oversight, including from the \nfirm’s risk committees. The idea emerged in a \nsupposedly non-risky part of the bank, and the \nteam overseeing the trades played it close to  \nthe vest and didn’t go through our normal risk \ncontrols.

This reminds me \nof another sin that promotes mistakes in compa-\nnies – hoarding information, which is a disease.\nAnd here is one of my big mistakes when I got to \nBank One. I’d been there for not quite a year, and \nI was in Louisville, where our business had been \nshrinking. I was trying to fix all that. I was in a \nlocal branch, and I realized that the branch \nacross the street’s hours were 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., \nand our hours were 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. I thought, \nwhoa, that’s not so good. I called up our branch \nmanagement, and they said, “Well, we’re differ-\nent – we’re not that kind of bank.” I asked them \nto do me a favor: Let’s find out for all of our \nbranches – we had about 1,800 at the time – \nwhat are our hours compared with the average \ncompetitor. And they said, “Well, how are we \ngoing to do that?” I said, “Well, email the other \nbranch managers, and ask them for their hours \nof operation.” And, it turns out, we were open \ntwo hours fewer a day.\nIt was a Friday, and I went home a bit embar-\nrassed. I came in on Monday, and it just so  \nhappened that the whole branch management \nteam was there. And here’s what I said to them: \n“I apologize. I thought I was a pretty good CEO, \nbut I messed up, I made a mistake. I should have \nrecognized this much sooner.” However, not one \nsalesperson, not one branch manager, not one \nregional manager, not one district manager \nnoticed this or mentioned it. Now that I was \naware of the issue, I told them all that we must \nchange our hours. Morale was already bad, and \neveryone went on and on about morale because \nwe had to change our work hours – and it was \ndifficult and complicated. But I said, “We’ve got \nto change it. We’re here for customers. Obvi-\nously, I care about morale – but morale sucks \nbecause we suck. Morale will get better when \nwe’re better as a company.” \nWHAT THE HECK IS CULTURE? \nWhat is culture anyway? I struggle with this one \na little bit because I think it’s a lot of the things \nI’m speaking about here. A great culture is cre-\nated by what you do and not by what you say. \nWhen we talk about the culture of our company, \nwe include the hundreds of thousands of people \nwho work for our company and what they believe \nin, as well as the role of our company in society. \nFor those people, our employees, we work hard \nto foster an environment that enables them to \nthrive as curious, honest, hard-working and \nempathetic individuals who care not only about \neach other but about our customers as well – to \nbe people who want to do the right thing – and \nit’s very important we get this right. Of course, \nthere are good people and bad people, but I like \nto think we’re almost all good people. Similarly, \nthere can be people you don’t trust: Sometimes \nyou don’t trust them because they lie – or they \nshape the truth. Or you can’t trust them because \nyou don’t trust their judgment. Watch out for \nthem and don’t follow them.\nUnfortunately, sometimes the bad people are \nour customers. I fire bad clients: corporate  \nclients, individuals. There used to be a wealthy \nguy who would come into a branch yelling and \nscreaming. He was verbally abusive to our staff \nmultiple times. I finally heard about it and called \nhim and said, “I want you to take all your business \nout of the bank. And by the way, you’re not going \nto treat our people that way.” If we have a client \nwho is disrespectful to our people and the way  \nwe operate, we will fire them. And life will go on.\nAnd recognition is important. Recognition says \nsomeone did something that you didn’t, that \nthey taught you something. I was never particu-\nlarly good at recognition. But I’ve learned les-\nsons about recognition by watching “Ted Lasso” \nand observing David Novak, former CEO of Yum! \nBrands. They taught me that recognition is a \nform of humility and acknowledgment. And this \ndirectly aligns with our company’s values and, \nimportantly, our actions.

      "text": "Creating a good culture is possible only if every-\none understands a company’s purpose – in our \ncase, the role of our bank. I think our purpose is \nto lift up society, to help people, which is an \nenormous responsibility. We have millions of \ncustomers, employees and shareholders who \ncount on us. I think if you don’t share this vision, \nyou don’t belong at our company.\nAnd have a little heart. One example: Many years \nago, when I was new to JPMorganChase, I \nlearned that the company’s security guards had \nbeen outsourced – to save money. But after out-\nsourcing, the same guards continued coming to \nwork every day at the same salary, and I won-\ndered, “How could this be?” (FYI, this was \nbrought to my attention by the head of a large \nunion, who came to see me personally over the \nobjection of my management team.) The reason \nwe were saving money was because the benefits \nwere cut in half for the guards and their family \nmembers (currently worth more than $19,000 a \nyear), and the savings were split with us. This was \na heartless thing to do – and the second I found \nout, I reversed the decision. JPMorganChase’s \nsuccess will not be built off the backs of our \nguards – it will be the result of fair treatment of all \nof our employees – and we’re thankful that many \nof those guards are still with our company today.\nLEADING THE TEAM.\nIt’s very important to have regular business \nreviews and to attack problems by putting all the \ndead cats, the hard issues, on the table. Empha-\nsize the negatives. Make it fun and foster a col-\nlaborative environment when you’re facing \ntough subjects. Share all the facts and recognize \nthat disagreement is a good thing. \nLoyalty is earned when people receive full input \nand know that they’ve had a chance to offer \ntheirs. Everyone should provide their input, \nreview the facts and then make decisions – but \nnot before that. Sometimes in meetings, col-\nleagues urge others to “stay in your lane.” Abso-\nlutely do not stay in your lane! That is a bureau-\ncratic, stupid direction. Our biggest mistakes \nhappen when people think something is kind of \na problem, but they are afraid to raise it in the \nright room where it might be provocative. \nThere’s nothing wrong with disagreement. Ever. \nAnd make it fun. You know, it’s our job to have \nfun in life and make everything we do fun. Just \ndo it all the time in your unit and ask others to do \nthe same. \nFor example, see mom and dad when you go on \nthe road. When I went to Kenya this year, I invited \ntwo of our senior executives from Kenya who \nnow work for our company in the United States \nto join me – and we invited their mothers to \nattend the client reception in Nairobi. It was \nquite moving to meet their families – what a gift \nto see what those women had accomplished \nwith those wonderful kids. And moms and dads \nlove to see us. Also, when you take the manage-\nment teams to dinner, try to include their \nspouses. It’s a lot of fun, and you learn a lot \nabout each other on the team. \nWHY IT’S HARD TO ACHIEVE GOOD \nGROWTH AND INNOVATE.\nTesting and learning are important – there’s \nnothing that can’t be improved by testing and \nlearning. You can kill innovation with too many \nresources, too few resources or bureaucracy, \nand you’ve got to really think through what you \nare trying to accomplish. Similarly, it’s important \nto evaluate innovative ideas through testing and \nlearning rather than rote analysis, which can  \nstifle creativity. Companies that want to foster \ngrowth through forward thinking need to nurture \nthat effort and support innovation.\nThe conversions at both J.P. Morgan/Chase and \nBank One are good examples. There was resis-\ntance to the integration, and the conversions \nwere costly. They took time and different \nresources. But there were approximately seven \nloan systems, five deposit systems and 25 gen-\neral ledgers that all needed to be consolidated \nto develop the best systems. You just do the \ntough stuff like this. And then what happens \nwhen you get these consolidations done is  \nyou make the company better at it over time. \nTransformation is a constant effort to improve.\nIn many cases, expansion is fought – and it’s \nmost often fought from within the existing ranks. \nThe current workforce is often resistant to grow \nthe team because they think it’s going to come \nout of their compensation. That’s not right –  \nthe company pays for the additional bankers.  \nMANAGEMENT LEARNINGS\n55",

      "text": "I confronted this resistance years ago when we \nwanted to grow the Global Corporate Bank – \nagain, there was pushback from our current \nbankers. I saw the same resistance from within \nwhen we were growing Chase Wealth Manage-\nment. But we looked at how big the opportunity \nwas in each of these cases to grow, expand and \nbe able to compete more effectively. And each \nof these efforts has been a home run for us.\nMANAGEMENT TRICKS AND TOOLS. \nNow I want to talk about some management \ntricks and tools. \nEffective leaders are responsive and treat every-\none fairly and with respect. You have to be direct \nand honest, which is all about respect (though  \nI recognize I get too worked up sometimes!). But \nI’m not only talking about bosses – I’m talking \nabout people at every level. Treat everyone well, \nfrom clerks to CEOs, no matter who they are. \nWhile leaders should celebrate successes, it’s \nstill important to emphasize the negatives and \nfocus on continuous improvement. Be a skeptic \nbut not a cynic. Utilize management techniques \nthat work. \nI’m a big fan of this one: Write memos yourself. \nDon’t always let others write them for you. Simi-\nlarly, when I ask someone a question, I want to \nhear directly back from that person, not their \nboss’s boss up the chain. And if I call that person \ndirectly, I want to talk to them. And share all the \nfacts. Don’t hoard facts. The facts don’t lie. \nAnother tip: Always make follow-up lists. I keep \nmy own follow-up lists with me almost all the \ntime. Regarding communications, avoid man-\nagement pablum. It’s a pet peeve of mine. Talk \nlike you speak – get rid of the jargon. \nAnd turning to meetings, if one is required, make \nit count. I ALWAYS do the pre-read. I give it 100% \nof my attention. I see people in meetings all the \ntime who are getting notifications and personal \ntexts or who are reading emails. This has to stop. \nIt’s disrespectful. It wastes time. Finally, if you’re \ngoing to a meeting to present a new product or \nservice, write a press release about it. This exer-\ncise forces you to answer lots of questions peo-\nple are likely to ask. When you write down what \nyou’re going to say, it focuses the mind and \nhelps you explain things better.\nWork smarter, not longer. Don’t read the same \nemail two or three times. Most can be addressed \nimmediately. And while this all sounds serious, \nmake work fun. We spend the vast majority of \nour waking hours at work – it’s our job to try to \nmake it fun and fulfilling. \nAnd another important one: Take care of  \nyourself. If you don’t take care of yourself,  \nit doesn’t work.\nLast, always answer this question: “What would \nyou do if you were queen or king for a day?” \nThat’s the big one – what would you do? \nI’m going to stop here. Thank you for all the \ngreat things you said, for the great things you’ve \ndone. And just so you know, while I may be say-\ning this, I want to be self-critical, too. I’m awed by \nyou all. Thank you for spending time with me.\nTo see a similarly streamlined video of my  \nsession, click here.  \n \n56\nMANAGEMENT LEARNINGS",

I can’t even begin to express my heartfelt appreciation and \nrespect for the tremendous character and capabilities of the management team that got \nus through the good times and the bad times to where we stand today. And I recognize \nthat we all stand on the shoulders of many others who came before us in building this \nexceptional company of ours. \nA beautiful physical manifestation of our company is our new headquarters in New York City, \nwhich we look forward to opening later this year. It is a great example of how we treat our \npeople with wonderful places to work – in New York City, across the country and around the \nworld. Our new headquarters also shows how you can deconstruct something and rebuild it \nin a powerful way – that’s good for our colleagues, our clients and our community. \nI would also like to express my deep gratitude to the 300,000+ employees, and their \nfamilies, of JPMorganChase.

In 2024, \nwe launched our flagship generative AI \nproduct, LLM Suite, to more than \n200,000 of our colleagues around the \nworld. LLM Suite enables employees to \naccess leading GenAI capabilities on \ntheir desktop in a controlled environ-\nment that protects our customer and \ncompany data. In addition, it also \nenables businesses across the enter-\nprise to develop use cases and to  \nintegrate GenAI more easily into their \nworkflows by leveraging a shared set of \ncapabilities available on the platform. \nWhile we have made substantial  \nprogress in our AI journey over the \npast decade, we are still in the early \nstages.

Our strategy is focused on \ncreating excellent workspaces that \nhave more communal, collaborative \nand restorative areas, advanced envi-\nronmental systems and best-in-class \namenities. \nIt’s also why we are so excited to cut \nthe ribbon on our new headquarters \nbuilding, a true architectural marvel. \nWhen complete, it will be New York \nCity’s largest all-electric building \ntotally powered by renewable energy, \nwith net zero operational emissions. \nSpecial features include outdoor \nspaces, 30% more daylight and the \ncapacity to support more than 50,000 \nconnected devices, including comput-\ners and mobile devices, making it the \nmost connected, data-driven high-rise \nbuilding in New York City.\nWhen we invest in improving our real \nestate, not only are we investing in our \nemployees – we’re investing in the \nlocal community. We are a major \nemployer in local communities across \nthe globe, with thousands of employ-\nees who significantly contribute to  \nthe local economy surrounding their \nworkplace, stimulating additional jobs \nacross local industries such as restau-\nrants, coffee shops, dry cleaners, local \nretailers and gas stations. We recog-\nnize the critical role we play not only  \nas a steward of the global financial  \nsystem but also as a catalyst in boost-\ning local economic health in the com-\nmunities where we operate.\nOur Guiding Principles Remain Unchanged: \n•\t \nWe seek to make dreams possible for everyone, everywhere, every day.\n•\t \nWe do not believe that talent is concentrated in any particular demographic group(s) and are \ndedicated to equal employment opportunity for talent across all backgrounds. \n•\t \nWe strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination, harassment and abusive conduct of any kind. We are \ndedicated to treating all individuals fairly and with respect.\n•\t \nWe seek to attract and retain the best talent. We recognize that our people are our strength and the \ndiverse talents and perspectives they bring to our global workforce are directly linked to our success.\n•\t \nWe strive to build and foster an inclusive work environment where our employees are respected, \ntrusted and empowered. Our experience is that if our teams are more diverse, we will generate better \nideas and outcomes, enjoy a stronger corporate culture and outperform our competitors.\n•\t \nWe are dedicated – and in many places obligated – to supporting underserved communities as part \nof our commitment to corporate responsibility and long-term shareholder value. We strive to \nempower individuals and improve lives through our business practices and community outreach \nefforts that we have seen are good for customers, communities and our business.",

We bring that to life with passion \nand grit through every interaction we \nhave with our colleagues, customers \nand clients.\nOur business and people practices are \nall anchored to the correct governance \nand controls that hold us to account for \nthe policies and processes we put in \nplace. We have the highest standards of \nexcellence and are constantly asking \nourselves how we can get better. \nPart of that includes doing the right \nthing, upholding our code of conduct, \nand how we treat our customers and  \nclients – never turning anyone away \nbecause of who they are or what they \nbelieve. This Purpose also extends to \nour treatment of our employees and to \nour belief that a culture where everyone \nis afforded respect and dignity creates \nthe best workplace and business \noutcomes.\nIndeed, we believe our strong culture  \nis what makes us deliver so well for our \nshareholders, clients and customers, \nand that includes our belief in the  \npower of a diverse workforce, which \nstrengthens our business and builds \ntrust within our communities. As I  \nmentioned recently in a note to \nemployees, our Diversity, Opportunity \nand Inclusion organization, along with \nthe lines of business, HR and Corporate \nResponsibility, will continue our efforts \nto reach the most customers and  \nclients to grow our business, uplift  \nthe people and communities we serve, \nand create an inclusive workplace for \nour employees. \nWe will continuously evaluate programs \nacross every part of our business to \nensure they make commercial sense, \nare driving the right business outcomes \nand comply with current laws as they \nevolve.  And we’ll stay true to our long-\nstanding core principle and practice  \nof reducing barriers because we know \nthat talent and potential are equally  \ndistributed but that access and oppor-\ntunity are not.\nAs a global company, we are dedicated \nto serving communities worldwide, \nfrom Baltimore and Huntsville to Paris \nand Hyderabad. Initiatives born from \nthe model of our successful work in  \ncities like Detroit to spur economic \nopportunity have led to innovation in \nproducts and services. Our offerings – \nincluding affordable housing and the \nexpansion of branches, products and \nservices in urban and rural areas – are \nnow embedded in our everyday busi-\nness and are, and always have been, \navailable to all. Sometimes you start \nwith a problem statement around a \nvery particular issue or community,  \nbut the solutions benefit all. \nOur virtual call centers, first piloted in \nDetroit in 2022, have created more \nthan 200 jobs. Since 2022 we have \nexpanded to other cities, including \nAtlanta and Baltimore, where we \nrecently welcomed a new cohort of 40 \nemployees who are military spouses. \nHiring veterans is another win for \neveryone, and I’m proud to break  \nthe news here that the Veteran Jobs \nMission, a coalition of more than 300 \ncompanies that we helped to found in \n2011, just reached 1 million veterans \nhired. That includes nearly 20,000  \nveterans hired within our firm. Removing \nbarriers through these initiatives and \nothers, like our second chance hiring \nand tapping different communities  \nfor the skills and expertise that they \nlend our business, has helped our firm \nto thrive.\nSuccessful companies require thriving \ncommunities. It makes good business \nsense to invest in the broader \necosystem.\nOUR VALUES \nOur Purpose is realized through living \nour Values – Excellence, Heart, Service, \nCourage and Curiosity. \nEach one of these words and the ethos \nthey carry is what sets us apart: striving \nfor better every day; serving our cus-\ntomers, communities and each other \nwith heart; always having the courage \nto do the right thing – especially when \nit’s hard; and staying humble in our \napproach and curious to learn.  \nThis is how we deliver for our share- \nholders, invest in the JPMorganChase  \nof tomorrow and keep our business not \nonly running well, but also as one of the \nmost successful in the world – and our \npeople are the fuel that enables it all.  \nJennifer Piepszak Chief Operating Officer \nJennifer Piepszak Chief Operating Officer \nFUTURE-PROOFING THE COMPANY AND OUR OPERATIONS",

GROW, ENGAGE AND DEEPEN \nRELATIONSHIPS \nAcross CCB, we serve more than 84 \nmillion consumers and 7 million small \nbusiness clients1. We’ve grown con-\nsumer relationships by 14% from 2019 \n(3% year-over-year) and small business \nrelationships by 51% (10% year-over-\nyear) by engaging customers with \nproducts, services and seamless expe-\nriences across both digital and branch \nchannels. Our branches are still the \nstorefront of JPMorganChase, with \nmore than 41 million customers choos-\ning to visit a Chase branch in 2024,  \nup 12% since 2019 (4% year-over-year). \nNearly 71 million customers were  \ndigitally active, up 35% since 2019  \n(6% year-over-year). \nWe’re not just growing our customer \nbase. We’re also creating deep,  \nenduring relationships by investing in  \nindustry-leading products and capabil-\nities and improving the customer expe-\nrience. Today, 28% of customers have \nat least two discrete products with us, \nup from 24% in 2019 (27% in 2023). \n2. DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \nWe’re proud of our financial results, \nwhich are an outcome of a customer- \nfirst approach and a focus on opera-\ntional excellence. We manage the  \nbusiness with a long-term, through- \nthe-cycle view. While the goal is to \ndeliver best-in-class performance in \nany year or environment, we also aim  \nto realize durable and profitable growth \nthat is consistent with our 25% through- \nthe-cycle return on equity (ROE) target. \nFor the fourth consecutive year, we \nexceeded that objective, delivering  \na 32% ROE in 2024. \nConsumers remain healthy despite \nexcess cash having been largely \ndrained from their balance sheets, \nwhich, to date, we view as normaliza-\ntion. Spend remains strong, fueled by  \na healthy labor market. By recent his-\ntorical standards, today’s interest rates \nare elevated, even after a 100-basis-\npoint reduction in 2024, and yield- \nseeking behaviors continue, albeit at  \na slower pace. Importantly, we are  \nsuccessfully defending primary bank \nrelationships and capturing money in \nmotion. In 2024, we retained over 85% \nof flows within Banking and Wealth \nManagement.

We grew our distribution \ncapacity as we added an incremental \n800 bankers, approximately 300  \nadvisors and nearly 70 branches to our \nnetwork, all of which drive long-term \ngrowth. Through investments in data \nand technology, we’ve made great \nprogress modernizing our infrastruc-\nture and developing products custom-\ners love.

Additionally, \nwe saw strong account and transaction \ngrowth and engagement.\nAgainst a macroeconomic backdrop \nsimilar to 2023, credit remains in line \nwith expectations.\nMaintaining our #1 position across \nindustry-leading businesses \nWe’re the clear market leader in  \nConsumer and Business Banking, as \nwell as Card, on the back of strong  \nnew account acquisition and primary \nbank relationships. \nConsumer and Business Banking:  \nWe maintained the #1 position in 2024 \nand outperformed large bank peers \nwith 11.3% national retail deposit share, \nup 220 basis points since 2019 (down  \n7 basis points year-over-year). We also \nremained #1 in small business with \n9.7% primary bank share, up 28 basis \npoints since 2019 (up 25 basis points \nyear-over-year). We ended 2024  \nwith 44 million Consumer Banking  \nrelationships (up 4% year-over-year)\nand 7 million small business clients1  \n(up 10% year-over-year). Approximately \n80% of consumers and 65% of small \nbusiness owners with whom we have \nbanking relationships consider us their \nprimary bank. \nThis position reflects strong new \naccount acquisition, as well as over a \ndecade of investment in our branch \nnetwork. Historic investments continue \nto mature, and we invest for the future \nwith plans to get to 15% national retail \ndeposit share.\nBanking is local, and nearly 1 million \ncustomers walk into a Chase branch \neach day. The bank’s team of approxi-\nmately 50,000 experts helps custom-\ners transact, open accounts, and get \ninformation and advice. In 2024, 85% of \nbusiness checking accounts and nearly \n30% of Chase-branded cards were \nopened in branches. \nBranch expansion remains core to \nlong-term growth. Since 2019, we’ve \nadded over 860 new branches, more \nthan all large bank peers combined, \nand we are the only bank with a pres-\nence in all 48 contiguous states. As a \nresult, Chase covers more Americans \nthan any other bank, with 68% of the \nU.S. population within an accessible \ndrive to one of our branches. We are on \ntrack to meet the goals we announced \nlast year to build 500 new branches by \n2027, contributing to our long-term \nplans of reaching 75% of the national \npopulation within an accessible drive \nand over 50% within each state. This \ngoal demonstrates our commitment to \nproviding local banking services in all \ncommunities, from urban centers to \nrural areas across America’s heartland. \nIn 2024, we entered 10 new markets, \nopened approximately 150 new \nbranches – including the first two  \nJ.P. Morgan Financial Centers in  \nManhattan and San Francisco – and \nthree Community Center branches in \nthe Bronx and Brooklyn in New York \nCity and Columbus, Ohio. We’re also \ninvesting in existing branches, refresh-\ning nearly 450 in 2024. \nWe aim to be the bank for all and \nremain committed to evolving prod-\nucts, services and experiences to meet \nthe unique needs of each customer \nsegment. In 2024, we enhanced Secure \nBankingSM, a product geared toward \nemerging segments, and introduced \nJ.P. Morgan Private Client as a new tier \nin our affluent product continuum. We \nalso launched new tools to help small \nbusiness owners run their businesses, \nincluding invoicing, payroll and cus-\ntomer insights.\nThe First Republic integration is com-\nplete, and we’re proud to have retained \napproximately 90% of banking clients \nand over 95% of deposit balances across \nthe firm. In the Wealth Management \nbusinesses, we retained nearly 80%  \nof advisors and assets. \nCard: In 2024, we remained the #1 \ncredit card issuer in the U.S. and  \ncontinued to gain share. We increased \ntotal active accounts to nearly 60 mil-\nlion and outstandings to $214 billion \n(up 12% year-over-year).

In 2024, we reached over \n$23 billion in volume and are on track \nto reach $30 billion in volume in 2025. \nSince launching Connected Commerce \nin 2021, we’ve doubled volume on both \nTravel and Offers platforms. \nTravel – We maintained our rank as a \ntop five consumer leisure travel provider \nand secured the #3 spot6 in 2024.

Over the \npast five years, we have organically \nadded banking coverage of midsized \ncompanies across 24 new countries. \nExtending our capabilities adds tre-\nmendous value for our clients seeking \naccess to markets and capital around \nthe world. This international growth has \ncontributed to an increase in Banking \nand Payments revenue from roughly \n$25 billion to more than $35 billion over \nthe same period.\nWe are also investing in key growth \nsectors. Since the start of 2024, we’ve \nhired more than 300 bankers across \nGlobal Banking.

Over \nthe last five years, about half of the \nInvestment Banking wallet from  \nsponsors has come from middle- \nmarket-sized transactions8.

Strong collaboration among \nour Markets, Banking and Private Bank \nteams has resulted in differentiated \ndialogue with financial sponsor clients, \nwho are expected to drive a significant \namount of activity around the world.\nBy strengthening the partnership \nbetween Banking and Markets, we have \nbeen able to bolster our capabilities in \nprivate credit. Over the past four years, \nwe have successfully deployed more \nthan $10 billion in 100 direct lending \nfinancings. Recently, we announced \nthat we are dedicating up to $50 billion \nfrom our own balance sheet, along with \nnearly $15 billion from our co-lending \npartners, highlighting our determina-\ntion to be a leader in both the broadly \nsyndicated and private credit markets. \nOur investment also continues in  \nbanking the full Innovation Economy \necosystem – the network of venture- \nbacked companies, founders and \ninvestors – where we had nearly 30% \nclient growth in 2024.

As of today, 98%  \nof production applications have been \nsuccessfully migrated to strategic  \ndata centers and the public cloud, and \napproximately 50% of applications now \noperate on the public or private cloud. \nThis positions us to leverage cloud, \ndata and artificial intelligence (AI)  \ninnovations that will be critical for the \nfuture of our business. \nHARNESSING THE POWER OF \nOUR DATA \nThe CIB has incredibly rich proprietary \ndata assets. \nWe have made significant strides to \nbuild a data-driven business and  \ntransform the way we work. Using our \ndata, we are reimagining how we serve \nclients, manage risk and optimize  \nour operations. We are investing to \nbuild the data infrastructure needed  \nto integrate AI into our operating \nenvironment. \nThe CIB now has over 175 AI use cases \nin production, with large parts of our \nteam using our internal large language \nmodel platform to deliver insights and \nimprove efficiency across a range of \ndaily tasks. \nAmong other operational efficiency \ngains, AI and machine learning technol-\nogy has enabled the CIB to improve its \nknow your customer processes, lead-\ning to a nearly 40% reduction in unit \ncosts. It also meaningfully improved \nthe cost and effectiveness of sanctions \nscreening and fraud protection. \nMeanwhile, AI is enabling us to improve \nthe client experience and offering, \nusing data across the business to  \ncreate recommendations based on  \nclient interactions in over 40 countries. \nFirmwide data also plays a key role in \nthe unified client dashboard we are \ndeveloping for our bankers, an espe-\ncially important initiative as we look to \nbetter serve complex client segments \nlike financial sponsors. \nOther AI use cases include tools to  \nhelp corporate clients better predict \ncash flows, to optimize the use of  \ncapital in our trading business and,  \nin Global Research, to quickly find  \nrelevant insights from reports and  \neconomic data. \nMAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT \nAROUND THE WORLD \nWe are a purpose-led organization and \ncontinue to dedicate capital, expertise \nand resources to drive real impact for \nour clients and communities. \nIn 2024, we supported vital institutions \n– including hospitals, schools, non- \nprofits, state and local governments,",

Leveraging research \nand data, we focused on the areas \nwhere our firm’s expertise and resources \ncould make the greatest impact. As a \nresult, we devoted business, philan-\nthropic and human capital to promote \nneighborhood revitalization and afford-\nable housing, skills training and job \ncreation, small business growth and \nfinancial security for residents. Most \nimportant, despite being a bank head-\nquartered in New York City, we showed \nup like a bank headquartered in Detroit.\nThe firm’s investments in Detroit, which \nhelped spur economic growth through-\nout the city, also gave way to new com-\nmercial opportunities for our business. \nAs the city’s credit rating jumped from \njunk bond to investment grade status \nand as home values doubled, our  \nmarket share and commercial loans \nincreased; so did our consumer and \nbusiness banking accounts and bal-\nances. The takeaway – and business \nmodel it informed – was clear: Thriving \ncommunities are good for business. \nFast forward to today: The Corporate \nResponsibility department’s work is a \ncentral part of our firm’s strategy. With \nteam members around the world, we \nhelp JPMorganChase develop hyper- \nlocal solutions to community challenges \nand forge meaningful partnerships with \nleaders in the public, private and non-\nprofit sectors. This multipronged \napproach contributes to the firm’s resil-\niency through economic cycles and  \ncreates strong local business conditions \nthat bolster our competitive advantage. \nMany of our current initiatives that are \ndesigned to help generate economic \ngrowth originated in Detroit. Take our \nvirtual call centers (VCC), which pro-\nvide training and employment to cus-\ntomer service specialists who work \nfrom home. First launched in 2022, the \nVCC program grew from a collabora-\ntion with Detroit’s workforce agency \n(established with our help in 2017) to \nhelp us attract top talent in markets \nwhere we did not have traditional call \ncenters. Our VCC team members have \nearned high customer satisfaction  \nratings, leading us to expand the  \nprogram and tailor it to other markets, \nincluding Greater Baltimore, which \nrecently welcomed a cohort of employ-\nees who are military spouses, and \nAtlanta, which offers customer support \nin English and Spanish.\nSimilarly, in Detroit we partnered with \nnonprofit and local government lead-\ners to open Financial Empowerment \nCenters that offer guidance on how to \nmanage finances, pay down debt, \nincrease savings and access banking \nproducts. This model helped inspire \nmany of the services we provide in our \nCommunity Center branches, where \nwe help residents access affordable \nhome loans, low-cost checking \naccounts and financial health educa-\ntion workshops in neighborhoods in \nAkron (Ohio), Dallas, Minneapolis and \nNew Orleans, among others.\nAs we continually expand our work in \ncommunities, I am often asked, \n“Where’s the next Detroit?” My answer \nis simple: It’s every market we serve. \nFrom Columbus to the United King-\ndom, San Francisco to Alabama, we \ntake the time to understand a locale \nand what it needs to grow its economy. \nWe then apply lessons we’ve learned in \nDetroit and elsewhere to execute a tai-\nlored approach with goals like creating \njobs, training workers, increasing \naccess to housing and helping people \ngrow their savings – all while strength-\nening the firm’s bottom line. \nOur efforts in four very different mar-\nkets, described below, just scratch the \nsurface of how our team helps commu-\nnities build wealth and catalyzes com-\nmercial impact. Click here to learn more.\nCOLUMBUS, OHIO\nWith more than 18,000 employees, \n720,000 customers, 57,800 small busi-\nness clients and eight office buildings, \nit’s safe to say that JPMorganChase’s \npresence in Columbus is robust.\nAs one of the largest employers in  \nOhio, we have a bird’s-eye view of the \nincredible talent coming out of local \neducational institutions – but we  \nhave also observed that many workers \nstruggle to access career paths in \ngrowing industries. Given our own local \nhiring needs, as well as those of our  \nclients, over the last decade we have \nzeroed in on the opportunity to invest in \nstudents, supporting JPMorganChase’s \nrecruiting and the region’s long-term \neconomic outlook.\nIn 2020, we selected Columbus as one \nof five U.S. cities to participate in the \nfirm’s New Skills Ready Network, a five-\nyear, $35 million initiative to give young \npeople real-world work experiences \nand help them access high-wage, \nin-demand jobs across industries like \ninformation technology (IT) and health-\ncare.

That \npresentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, \nprovides the reader with an understanding of the \nFirm’s results that can be tracked consistently from \nyear-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s \nperformance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements \nof other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a \nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, \nincluding the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; \nthese Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP \nfinancial measures. The Firm also reviews the results \nof the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s \ndefinition of managed basis starts, in each case, with \nthe reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain \nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the \nFirm as a whole, and for each of the reportable \nbusiness segments and Corporate, on an FTE basis. \nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive \ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in \nthe managed results on a basis comparable to taxable \ninvestments and securities. These financial measures \nallow management to assess the comparability of \nrevenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable \nand tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income \ntax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded \nwithin income tax expense. These adjustments have \nno impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a \nwhole or by each of the lines of business and \nCorporate.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial \nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment levels \nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures \nprovide information to investors about the underlying \noperational performance and trends of the Firm or of \nthe particular business segment, as the case may be, \nand therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the \nbusiness segment with the performance of its relevant \ncompetitors.

Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable \nbusiness segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business \nsegments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the \nreorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & \nInvestment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. \nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer \nserved, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, \nwhose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a \nmanaged basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on \npages 67–69 for a definition of managed basis.\nThe following table depicts the Firm’s reportable business segments.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the reportable business segments are \nintended to present each segment as if it were a stand-\nalone business. The management reporting process \nthat derives business segment results includes the \nallocation of certain income and expense items. The \nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions, \nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for \nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements \nmay be implemented in future periods.

      "text": "Expense allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by \nCorporate support units, or another business segment, \nthe costs of those services are allocated to the \nrespective business segments. The expense is \ngenerally allocated based on the actual cost and use of \nservices provided. In contrast, certain costs and \ninvestments related to Corporate that are not currently \nutilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business \nsegments and are retained in Corporate. Expense \nretained in Corporate generally includes costs that \nwould not be incurred if the segments were stand-\nalone businesses, and other items not solely aligned \nwith a particular reportable business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which \nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the \nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary \ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the \ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets \nand liabilities and off-balance sheet products. \nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions \nutilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect \neconomic conditions and other factors, which may \nimpact the allocation of net interest income to the \nsegments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the \nFirm updated its FTP with respect to consumer \ndeposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding \nbenefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that \nis fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s \nnet interest income.\nAs a result of higher average interest rates, the cost of \nfunds for assets and the FTP benefit earned for \nliabilities have generally increased in the current year, \nimpacting the net interest income of the business \nsegments. During the period ended December 31, \n2024, this has resulted in a higher cost of funds for \nloans and Markets activities. In addition, rates paid to \ndeposit holders increased more than the FTP benefit \nincrease during the year, resulting in deposit margin \ncompression.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs \nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain \nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages \nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign \nexchange rate movements related to the transferred \nrisk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on \npage 149 for additional information.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the \ncredit spread component of outstanding unsecured \nlong-term debt and preferred stock dividends is \nallocated to the reportable business segments, while \nthe balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The \nmethodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-\nterm debt and preferred stock dividends to the \nbusiness segments is aligned with the relevant \nregulatory capital requirements and funding needs of \nthe LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of \nunsecured long-term debt is included in a business \nsegment’s net interest income, and net income is \nreduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a \nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common \nequity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages \n97–107 for additional information.\nCapital allocation \nThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and \nCorporate is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current \nequity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III \nStandardized risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the \nglobal systemically important banks (“GSIB”) \nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well \nas a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress \nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions, \njudgments and methodologies used to allocate capital \nare reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to \nthe LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of \nbusiness and Corporate equity on page 104 for \nadditional information on capital allocation. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n71",

Markets \nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity \nMarkets. Markets revenue consists of principal \ntransactions, fees, commissions and other income, as \nwell as net interest income. The Firm assesses its \nMarkets business performance on a total revenue \nbasis, as offsets generally occur across revenue line \nitems. For example, securities that generate net \ninterest income may be risk-managed by derivatives \nthat are reflected at fair value in principal transactions \nrevenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the \ncomposition of these income statement line items. \nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial \ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise \nfrom client-driven market-making activity. Principal \ntransactions revenue includes amounts recognized \nupon executing new transactions with market \nparticipants, as well as “inventory-related revenue,” \nwhich is revenue recognized from gains and losses on \nderivatives and other instruments that the Firm has \nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client \ndemand, and changes in the fair value of instruments \nused by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure \narising from such inventory. Principal transactions \nrevenue recognized upon executing new transactions \nwith market participants is affected by many factors \nincluding the level of client activity, the bid-offer \nspread (which is the difference between the price at \nwhich a market participant is willing and able to sell an \ninstrument to the Firm and the price at which another \nmarket participant is willing and able to buy it from the \nFirm, and vice versa), market liquidity and \nvolatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive \nto the same factors that drive inventory-related \nrevenue, which include general market conditions, \nsuch as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit \nspreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as \nother macroeconomic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n81\n2024 Share \n2023 Share \n2022 Share",

      "text": "Asset Management has two high-level measures \nof its overall fund performance.\n• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under \nmanagement in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating \nservices rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance \nover various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and \nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star \nrating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. \nA 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked \nfunds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-\nwide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and \nrepresents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An \noverall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of \nthe performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- \nyear (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-\ndomiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the \nindividual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based \non three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer \nthan three years of history are not rated and hence excluded \nfrom these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories \nand the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced \nfrom the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the \nfund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. \ndollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the \nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary \nshare class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, \nexcept for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund \nlevel. The performance data may have been different if all share \nclasses had been included. Past performance is not indicative of \nfuture results.\n• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under \nmanagement in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, \nthree and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer \ncategories and the asset values used to derive these rankings \nare sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings \nare based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where \napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values \ninto U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund \nperformance and associated peer rankings at the share class \nlevel for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to \nrepresent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong \nKong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The \nperformance data may have been different if all share classes \nhad been included. Past performance is not indicative of future \nresults.\n“Primary share class” means the C share class for European \nfunds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan \nfunds.

      "text": "FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase’s business \nactivities. When the Firm extends a consumer or \nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their \ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or \noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on \nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to \nmanage its business, and the associated risks, in a \nmanner that balances serving the interests of its \nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the \nsafety and soundness of the Firm. \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management \nrequires, among other things:  \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification \nand escalation of risks by all individuals within the \nFirm;  \n• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data \nand management within each of the LOBs and \nCorporate; and \n• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced \ncompensation framework with strong internal \ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board \nof Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and \ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s \nperformance evaluation and incentive compensation \nprocesses. \nRisk governance framework\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves \nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks and \nimpacts of risks. \nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. \nDrivers of risks include the economic environment, \nregulatory or government policy, competitor or market \nevolution, business decisions, process or judgment \nerror, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets \nand natural disasters.\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest \nthemselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized \nin the following four risk types: \n• \nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, \nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly-\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate \nresponse to changes in the operating environment. \n• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with \nthe default or change in credit profile of a client, \ncounterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a \nreduction in expected returns on investments, \nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk \nand investment portfolio risk. \n• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of \nchanges in market factors, such as interest and \nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity \nprices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the \nvalue of assets and liabilities held for both the short \nand long term. \n• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome \nresulting from inadequate or failed internal \nprocesses or systems; human factors; or external \nevents impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. \nOperational risk includes cybersecurity, compliance, \nconduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both \nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many \nconsequences when risks manifest themselves, \nincluding quantitative impacts such as a reduction in \nearnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or \npenalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the \nFirm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and \nregulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on \na Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk \nManagement (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of \nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief \nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval \nby the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the \n“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer \n(“CRO”) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk \ngovernance framework of the Firm. The framework is \nsubject to approval by the Board Risk Committee \nthrough its review and approval of the Risk \nGovernance and Oversight Policy.\nThe Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to \nthe Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk \nOfficers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and \nthe Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in \nturn, establish Risk Management and Compliance \norganizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance \npolicies and standards, and define and oversee the \nimplementation of the Firm’s risk governance \nframework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in \ntheir LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks \nthat span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as \nfunctions and regions. Each area of the Firm that gives \nrise to risk is expected to operate within the \nparameters identified by the IRM function, and within \nthe risk and control standards established by its own \nmanagement. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n91\nThe Firm's risk governance and oversight functions align to: \nDrivers of Risks \nFactors that \ncause a risk \nto exist \nTypes of Risks \nCategories \nby which risks manifest \nthemselves \nImpacts of Risks \nConsequences of risks, \nboth quantitative and \nqualitative",

The first line of defense owns \nthe risks, and identification of risks, associated with \ntheir respective activities and the design and \nexecution of controls to manage those risks. \nResponsibilities also include adherence to applicable \nlaws, rules and regulations and implementation of the \nrisk governance framework established by IRM, which \nmay include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and \ncontrols. \nThe second line of defense is the IRM function, which is \nseparate from the first line of defense and is \nresponsible for independently measuring risk, as well \nas assessing and challenging the risk management \nactivities of the first line of defense. IRM is also \nresponsible for the identification of risks within its \norganization, its own adherence to applicable laws, \nrules and regulations and for the development and \nimplementation of policies and standards with respect \nto its own processes. \nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an \nindependent function that provides objective \nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of \nFirmwide processes, controls, governance and risk \nmanagement. The Internal Audit function is led by the \nGeneral Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee \nand administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute to \nthe Firmwide control environment but are not \nconsidered part of a particular line of defense, \nincluding Corporate Finance, Human Resources and \nLegal. These other functions are responsible for the \nidentification of risks within their respective \norganizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and \nregulations and implementation of the risk governance \nframework established by IRM.\nRisk identification and ownership\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the \nidentification of risks within their respective \norganizations, as well as the design and execution of \ncontrols, including IRM-specified controls, to manage \nthose risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk \nidentification framework designed to facilitate the \nresponsibility of each LOB and Corporate to identify \nmaterial risks inherent to the Firm’s businesses and \noperational activities, catalog them in a central \nrepository and review material risks on a regular basis. \nThe IRM function reviews and challenges the risks \nidentified by each LOB and Corporate, maintains the \ncentral repository and provides the consolidated \nFirmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee \n(“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. \nRisk appetite\nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by Risk \nAppetite frameworks for quantitative and qualitative \nrisks. The Firm’s risk appetite is periodically set and \napproved by senior management (including the CEO \nand CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. \nQuantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to \nmonitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk \nconsistent with its stated risk appetite.

The Firm’s “fortress balance sheet” \nphilosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong \ncapital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk \nmanagement strategy focuses on maintaining long-\nterm stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in \nmarket-leading businesses, including in highly \nstressed environments. Senior management considers \nthe implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making \nsignificant decisions that could impact future business \nactivities. In addition to considering the Firm’s \nearnings outlook, senior management evaluates all \nsources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the \nFirm’s capital strength.\nCapital risk management\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function \nwhose primary objective is to provide independent \noversight of capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:\n• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk \nmetrics;\n• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk \nlimits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;\n• Developing processes to classify, monitor and report \ncapital limit breaches; \n• Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital \nmanagement activities, including changes made to \nthe Contingency Capital Plan described below; and\n• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory \ncapital framework intended to ensure compliance \nwith applicable regulatory capital rules.\nCapital management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital \nmanagement.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital \nmanagement are to:\n• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to \nbuild and invest in the Firm’s businesses through \nnormal economic cycles and in stressed \nenvironments;\n• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future \ninvestment opportunities;\n• Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a \nsource of strength to its subsidiaries;\n• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum \nregulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-\ncapitalized” status for the Firm and its principal \ninsured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiary, \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at all times under \napplicable regulatory capital requirements;\n• Meet capital distribution objectives; and\n• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate \nthroughout a resolution period in accordance with \nthe Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through: \n• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements \nand maintaining a strong capital governance \nframework. The internal minimum capital levels \nconsider the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements \nas well as an internal assessment of capital \nadequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress \nevents;\n• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of \npotential events; and\n• Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and \nfollowing prescribed escalation protocols, both at \nthe Firm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s \ncapital management include the Capital Governance \nCommittee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional \nALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) \nRisk Committee.

The Firm’s \nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including \nregulatory buffers, was 12.3% as of December 31, 2024.\nRefer to Capital actions on page 105 for information on \nactions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors. \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process \nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs \nthe Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of \nthe Firm’s processes for managing the sources and \nuses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory \nexpectations for capital planning and capital \nadequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing \nprotocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit \nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving \nthe capital planning framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of \nalternative economic and business scenarios on the \nFirm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and \nthe parameters underlying those scenarios, are \ndefined centrally and applied uniformly across the \nbusinesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of \nmacroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of \nbusiness results; global market shocks, which \ngenerate short-term but severe trading losses; and \nidiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios \nare intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities \nand idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to \nCCAR and other periodic stress testing, management \nalso considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity \nanalyses, as necessary. \nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the \ncapital management framework for the Firm and \nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach \ntowards capital management in normal economic \nconditions and in stressed environments. The \nContingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm \ncalibrates its targeted capital levels and meets \nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing \nappropriateness of planned capital distributions, and \nsets out the capital contingency actions that are \nexpected to be taken or considered at various levels of \ncapital depletion during a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, \nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a \nconsolidated financial holding company. The Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes \nsimilar minimum capital requirements and standards \nfor the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally \nfollow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as \namended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum \ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards \nfor large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and \nbanks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, \nN.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that \nmust be held by BHCs and banks is determined by \ncalculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets \nand off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according \nto risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two \ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for \ncalculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III \nStandardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III \nAdvanced”). \nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital \nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of \nthe Standardized or Advanced approaches compared \nto their respective regulatory capital ratio \nrequirements.\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital \nrequirements for calculating credit risk RWA and \nmarket risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, \noperational risk RWA. Key differences in the \ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the \nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for \nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-\nsensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of \ninternal credit models and parameters, whereas for \nBasel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally \nbased on supervisory risk-weightings which vary \nprimarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market \nrisk RWA is generally calculated consistently between \nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In \naddition to the RWA calculated under these \napproaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts \nto incorporate management judgment and feedback \nfrom its regulators.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Firm’s Basel III \nStandardized ratios risk-based ratios were more \nbinding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios. \nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Advanced \nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm, \ncalculate their SLRs. \nRefer to page 104 for additional information on SLR.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n98\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

Under this \nproposal, changes to the framework would include \nreplacement of the Advanced approach with an \nexpanded risk-based approach for the calculation of \nRWA. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement \nwould be applicable to both the expanded risk-based \napproach and the Standardized approach.\nGSIB Surcharge and TLAC and Eligible LTD \nRequirements\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve released a proposal \nto amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Under \nthe proposal, the annual GSIB surcharge would be \nbased on an average of the quarterly surcharge \ncalculations throughout the calendar year, with daily \naveraging required for certain measures. The proposal \nwould also reduce surcharge increments from 50 bps \nto 10 bps and includes other technical amendments to \nthe “Method 2” calculation. The proposed changes \nwould revise risk-based capital requirements for the \nFirm and other U.S. GSIBs. Refer to Risk-based Capital \nRegulatory Requirements on page 100 for further \ninformation on the GSIB surcharge. \nAdditionally, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the \nFDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand the \neligible long-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean \nholding company requirements under the existing \ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to \nnon-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total \nconsolidated assets. The proposal would also reduce \nthe amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less \nthan two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC \nrequirement and expand the existing capital deduction \nframework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD \nissued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD \nrequirements. \nFinalization of the above proposals, including the \nrequired implementation dates, is uncertain.

The capital \nconservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a \ndiscretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed \ncapital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced \nregulatory capital requirements, as well as a variable \nSCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized \nregulatory capital requirements. \nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is \nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual \nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based \non data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject \nto the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB \nsurcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s \nassessment methodology, and is calculated across \nfive criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, \ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. \n“Method 2” modifies the Method 1 requirements to \ninclude a measure of short-term wholesale funding in \nplace of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score \n“multiplication factor”. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB \nsurcharge for the years ended December 31, 2024 and \n2023.

In addition, the Board Risk Committee \nreviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for \napproval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity \nstrategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk \nManagement on pages 91–95 for further discussion of \nALCO and other risk-related committees. \nInternal stress testing\nThe Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to \nmonitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material \nlegal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, \nincluding scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s \nresolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests \nare produced on a daily basis, and other stress tests \nare performed in response to specific market events or \nconcerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the \nFirm’s contractual financial obligations are met and \ntake into consideration: \n• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured \nfunding markets; \n• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash \noutflows;\n• Credit rating downgrades; \n• Collateral haircuts; and \n• Potential impediments to the availability and \ntransferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and \nmaterial legal entities such as regulatory, legal or \nother restrictions. \nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time \nhorizons and currency dimensions and contemplate \nboth market and idiosyncratic stresses. \nResults of stress tests are considered in the \nformulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment \nof its liquidity position.

The CFP also identifies the \nalternative contingent funding and liquidity resources \navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of \nstress. \nLCR and HQLA\nThe LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA \nthat is sufficient to meet their respective estimated \ntotal net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for \npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of \nunencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational \nconsiderations as defined in the LCR rule.

Refer to the \nFirm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available \non the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the \nFirm’s LCR.\nLiquidity sources\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible \nHQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered \nmarketable securities, such as equity and debt \nsecurities, that the Firm believes would be available to \nraise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA \nsecurities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not \ntransferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of \nthese securities was approximately $594 billion and \n$649 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, although the amount of liquidity that \ncould be raised at any particular time would be \ndependent on prevailing market conditions. The \ndecrease compared to December 31, 2023, was driven \nby reductions in unencumbered AFS securities in \nTreasury and CIO, excess eligible HQLA securities at \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB \ntrading assets.\nThe Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available \ncash and securities as of both December 31, 2024 and \n2023. For each respective period, the amount was \ncomprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding \nthe impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately \n$834 billion and $798 billion, and unencumbered \nmarketable securities with a fair value of \napproximately $594 billion and $649 billion.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the \nFederal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount \nwindow at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of \ncollateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of \napproximately $413 billion and $340 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This \nborrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and \nsecurities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other \nunencumbered securities that are currently pledged at \nthe Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other \ncentral banks. Available borrowing capacity increased \nfrom December 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher \namount of commercial loans and credit card \nreceivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. \nAlthough available, the Firm does not view this \nborrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks \ndiscount window and the other central banks as a \nprimary source of liquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity \nrequirement for large banking organizations that is \nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” \nstable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” \namounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.  \nFor the three months ended December 31, 2024, both \nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were \ncompliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, \nbased on the Firm’s interpretation of the final NSFR \nrule.

The Firm provides credit to a variety of \nclients and customers, ranging from large corporate \nand institutional clients to individual consumers and \nsmall businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm \nis exposed to credit risk primarily through its home \nlending, credit card, auto, and business banking \nbusinesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is \nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting, \nlending, market-making, and hedging activities with \nand for clients and counterparties, as well as through \nits operating services activities (such as cash \nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities \nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit \nrisk through its investment securities portfolio and \ncash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors and measures \ncredit risk throughout the Firm, and defines credit risk \npolicies, procedures and limits. The Firm’s credit risk \nmanagement governance includes the following \nactivities:\n• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n• Monitoring and measuring credit risk across all \nportfolio segments, including transaction and \nexposure approval\n• Setting industry and geographic concentration \nlimits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines for \ncredit review and analysis\n• Assigning and maintaining credit approval \nauthorities in connection with the approval of credit \nexposure\n• Monitoring and independent assessment of \ncriticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\n• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate \ncredit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several \nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor \nor counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring \ncredit risk vary depending on several factors, including \ntype of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk \nmeasurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status \nand borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-\nrating) and risk management and collection processes \n(e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed \nworkout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on \nthe probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, \nthe loss severity given a default event and the \nexposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and \nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm \nestimates credit losses for its exposures. The \nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit \nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects estimated credit losses \nrelated to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and \nthe allowance for investment securities reflects \nestimated credit losses related to the investment \nsecurities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and \nCritical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on \npages 161–164 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are \nreflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and \nrepresent the potential volatility of actual losses \nrelative to the established allowances for loan losses \nand lending-related commitments. The analyses for \nthese losses include stress testing that considers \nalternative economic scenarios as described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing \ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress \ntesting process assesses the potential impact of \nalternative economic and business scenarios on \nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic \nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined \ncentrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic \nfactors and applied across the businesses. The stress \ntest results may indicate credit migration, changes in \ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit \nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing \nprocesses, management also considers additional \nstresses outside these scenarios, including industry \nand country- specific stress scenarios, as appropriate. \nThe Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on \nsetting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as \nwell as to assess the impact of stress on individual \ncounterparties.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n117",

Total criticized exposure, excluding \nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $44.7 billion and $41.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrepresenting approximately 3.5% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $44.7 billion, \n$39.9 billion was performing.

      "text": "Lending-related commitments\nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, \nsuch as commitments (including revolving credit \nfacilities) and guarantees, to address the financing \nneeds of its clients. The contractual amounts of these \nfinancial instruments represent the maximum possible \ncredit risk should the clients draw down on these \ncommitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations \nunder these guarantees, and the clients subsequently \nfail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. \nMost of these commitments and guarantees have \nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or \nexpired without being drawn upon or a default \noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the \ntotal contractual amount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative of the Firm’s \nexpected future credit exposure or funding \nrequirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information \non wholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment \nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM \nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the \nclients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, \nand primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or \nequity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm \nestablishes margin requirements and monitors the \nrequired margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires \nclients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or \nto reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising \nfrom lending activities subject to collateral maintenance \nrequirements is generally mitigated by factors such as \nthe short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of \ncollateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the \nborrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when \nthe fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these \nmitigating factors, these receivables generally do not \nrequire an allowance for credit losses. However, if in \nmanagement’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses \nis required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses \nbased on the value of the collateral and probability of \nborrower default. These receivables are reported within \naccrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s \nConsolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s \naccounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage \nrisk, including credit risk and risks arising from \nfluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and \nequities and commodities prices. The Firm makes \nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and \nuses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with \nnet open risk positions from its market-making \nactivities, including the counterparty credit risk arising \nfrom derivative receivables. The Firm also uses \nderivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and \nother market risk exposure. The nature of the \ncounterparty and the settlement mechanism of the \nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is \nexposed. For over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, the \nFirm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative \ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), \nsuch as futures and options, and cleared over-the-\ncounter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also \nbe exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where \npossible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk \nexposures arising from derivative contracts through the \nuse of legally enforceable master netting arrangements \nand collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s \nOTC derivative transactions subject to collateral \nagreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, \nwhich are not typically covered by collateral agreements \ndue to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades \nthat are settled daily — was approximately 86% and 87% \nat December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to \nNote 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of \ncollateral agreements and for a further discussion of \nderivative contracts, counterparties and settlement \ntypes.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the \nConsolidated balance sheets was $61.0 billion and $54.9 \nbillion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The \nincrease was primarily as a result of market movements. \nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of the \nderivative contracts after giving effect to legally \nenforceable master netting agreements and the related \ncash collateral held by the Firm.\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other \ncash collateral that may be used as security when the \nfair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. \nFor these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is \nconsistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets \nas defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of \ncurrent credit risk should also take into consideration \nother collateral, which generally represents securities \nthat do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the \nLCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral \namounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally \nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to the \nnet amount of the derivative receivables for each \ncounterparty.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, \nG7 government securities, other liquid government \nagency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt \nand equity securities) delivered by clients at the \ninitiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to \ncontracts that have a non-daily call frequency and \ncollateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not \nyet settled as of the reporting date. Although this \ncollateral does not reduce the receivables balances and \nis not included in the tables below, it is available as \nsecurity against potential exposure that could arise \nshould the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts \nmove in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional \ninformation on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements \nfor derivative transactions.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n134\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

Peak is the primary measure \nused by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative \ncontracts, senior management reporting and \nderivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of \nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, \non a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan \nexposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential \ncredit loss than Peak.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of \nthe Firm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit \nof collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total \nlife of the derivative contract is used as the primary \nmetric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate \ncredit risk capital and CVA, as further described below. \nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables \nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of \ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a \ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in \nthe credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that \nactive risk management is essential to controlling the \ndynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In \naddition, the Firm’s risk management process for \nderivatives exposures takes into consideration the \npotential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly \ndefined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is \npositively correlated with the impact of a default by the \nsame counterparty, which could cause exposure to \nincrease at the same time as the counterparty’s \ncapacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many \nfactors may influence the nature and magnitude of \nthese correlations over time. To the extent that these \ncorrelations are identified, the Firm may adjust the \nCVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. \nThe Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by \nentering into credit derivative contracts, as well as \ninterest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity \nderivative contracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s \ncurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as \ncalculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The \nthree measures generally show that exposure will \ndecline after the first year, if no new trades are added \nto the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2024\n (in billions) \nAVG\nDR E\nPeak\n1 \nyear\n2 \nyears\n5 \nyears\n10 \nyears\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n135\n2024 % of exposure net of collateral \n2023 % of exposure net of collateral",

      "text": "Value-at-risk\nJPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a \nstatistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss \nfrom adverse market moves in the current market \nenvironment. The Firm has a single VaR framework \nused as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR \nand Regulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using \nhistorical simulation based on data for the previous 12 \nmonths. The framework’s approach assumes that \nhistorical changes in market values are representative \nof the distribution of potential outcomes in the \nimmediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk \nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that \nis closely aligned to risk management decisions made \nby the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other \nmarket risk measures, provides the appropriate \ninformation needed to respond to risk events. \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated \nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected \ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% \nconfidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a \nconsistent framework to measure risk profiles and \nlevels of diversification across product types and is \nused for aggregating risks and monitoring limits \nacross businesses. VaR results are reported as \nappropriate to various groups including senior \nmanagement, the Board Risk Committee and \nregulators.  \nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are \nindividual VaR models that simulate historical market \nreturns for individual risk factors and/or product types. \nTo capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s \nrisk management framework, comprehensive VaR \nmodel calculations are performed daily for businesses \nwhose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR \nmodels are granular and incorporate numerous risk \nfactors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market \nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected \nbased on the risk profile of each portfolio, as \nsensitivities and historical time series used to generate \ndaily market values may be different across product \ntypes or risk management systems. The VaR model \nresults across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm \nlevel.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect \nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future \nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on available \nhistorical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, \nVaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to \nmeasure certain risks and to predict losses, \nparticularly those associated with market illiquidity \nand sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. \nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not \ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and \navailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm \nuses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other \nproducts when daily time series are not available. It is \nlikely that using an actual price-based time series for \nthese products, if available, would affect the VaR \nresults presented. The Firm therefore considers other \nnonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in \naddition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk \npositions. \nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a \nconsistent source for valuation, the daily market data \nused may be different than the independent third-\nparty data collected for VCG price testing in its \nmonthly valuation process. For example, in cases \nwhere market prices are not observable, or where \nproxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data \nsources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note \n2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation \nprocess. \nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically \nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the \ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in \nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s \nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other \nfactors. Such changes may affect historical \ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and \nModel Risk Management on page 160 for information \nregarding model reviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR \nin accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory \nVaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory \nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital \nrules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently \nassumes a ten business-day holding period and an \nexpected tail-loss methodology which approximates a \n99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to \n“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, \nwhich may be different than the positions included in \nthe Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit \nderivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the \nFirm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR \nexcludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in \ncontrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, \nRegulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification \nbenefit for certain VaR models.\nRefer to JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory \nCapital Disclosures reports, which are available on the \nFirm’s website, for additional information on \nRegulatory VaR and the other components of market \nrisk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based \nmeasure, stressed VaR-based measure and the \nrespective backtesting).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n143",

      "text": "VaR backtesting\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which \ncompares the daily Risk Management VaR results with \nthe daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR \nbacktesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted \nin the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported \nrevenue as they exclude certain components of total \nnet revenue, such as those associated with the \nexecution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-\ndriven trading and intraday risk management \nactivities), fees, commissions, other valuation \nadjustments and net interest income. These excluded \ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset \nthe backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The \ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is \nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting \nunder Basel III capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily \nbacktesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management \nVaR for the prior day.

      "text": "Other risk measures \nStress testing \nAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool \nused to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss \ndue to adverse changes in markets using recent \nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects the \nrisk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of \nmarket risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. \nStress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to \nlosses under a range of stressed but possible \neconomic and market scenarios. The results are used \nto understand the exposures responsible for those \npotential losses and are measured against limits. \nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk \nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The \nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of \npotential stress for both market rallies and market sell-\noffs, assuming significant changes in market factors \nsuch as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, \ncurrency rates and commodity prices, and combines \nthem in multiple ways to capture an array of \nhypothetical economic and market scenarios.  \nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus \non tail events in specific asset classes and \ngeographies, including how the event may impact \nmultiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also \nincorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress \nbasis risk between different products. The flexibility in \nthe stress framework allows the Firm to construct new \nscenarios that can test the outcomes against possible \nfuture stress events. Stress testing results are \nreported periodically to senior management of the \nFirm, as appropriate. \nStress methodologies are governed by the overall \nstress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk \nManagement. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress \nMethodology Committee reviews and approves \nchanges to stress testing methodology and scenarios \nacross the Firm. Significant changes to the framework \nare escalated to senior management, as appropriate. \nIn addition, stress methodology and the models to \ncalculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s \nEstimations and Model Risk Management Policy  \nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in \ncalculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test \nresults, which are reported periodically to the Board of \nDirectors. In addition, stress testing results are \nincorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, \nand are reported periodically to the Board Risk \nCommittee. \nProfit and loss drawdowns \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight \ntrading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A \nprofit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from \nits year-to-date peak level.\nStructural interest rate risk management \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s \nreported net income is important as interest rate risk \nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. \nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading activities \nwhich are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s \ntraditional banking activities, which include extension \nof loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing \ndebt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and \nassociated derivative instruments. Refer to the table \non page 142 for a summary by LOB and Corporate \nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nGovernance\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s \ninterest rate risk management policy and related \nlimits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk \nCommittee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership \nwith the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest \nrate risk profile and reviews it with senior \nmanagement, including the CTC Risk Committee. In \naddition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is \nmanaged through a dedicated risk function reporting \nto the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for \nproviding independent oversight and governance \naround assumptions and establishing and monitoring \nlimits for structural interest rate risk, including limits \nrelated to Earnings-at-Risk and Economic Value \nSensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate \nrisk generally through its investment securities \nportfolio and interest rate derivatives.\nKey risk drivers and risk management process\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of \nfactors, including:\n• Differences in timing among the maturity or \nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet \ninstruments\n• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and \noff-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or \nrepricing at the same time\n• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and \nlong-term market interest rates change (for \nexample, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\n• The impact of changes in the maturity of various \nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as \ninterest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its \nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide \nbasis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to \nTreasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, \nwhich takes into account the elements of interest rate \nexposure that can be risk-managed in financial \nmarkets.

Earnings-at-risk \nestimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given \ninterest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to \na baseline, which includes net interest income and \ncertain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses \nmarket interest rates and, in the case of deposits, \npricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of \nchanges to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive \nassets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and \nother currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These \nsimulations primarily include retained and held-for-\nsale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing \nactivities, investment securities, long-term debt,  \nrelated interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing \nof other positions in risk management VaR and other \nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 142. \nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these \nsimulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar \nforeign exchange exposures arising from capital \ninvestments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange \nrisk on page 149 for more information.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential \nchange to a baseline over the following 12 months \nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios \ninclude a parallel shift involving changes to both short-\nterm and long-term rates by an equal amount; a \nsteeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates \nconstant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter \nyield curve involving increasing short-term rates and \nholding long-term rates constant or holding short-\nterm rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. \nThese scenarios consider many different factors, \nincluding: \n• The impact on exposures as a result of \ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from \nbaseline rates.\n• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled \nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but \nexcluding assumptions about actions that could be \ntaken by the Firm or its clients and customers in \nresponse to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage \nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest \nrates used in the scenarios compared with \nunderlying contractual rates, the time since \norigination, and other factors which are updated \nperiodically based on historical experience. Deposit \nforecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s \nearnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain \nassumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s \nbalance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening \nand usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that \nrequire management judgment. The amount of \ndeposits that the Firm holds at any given time may \nbe influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as \nbroader monetary conditions and competition for \ndeposits.\n• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit \nbetas, represent the amount by which deposit rates \npaid could change upon a given change in market \ninterest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ \nfrom the modeled assumptions, primarily due to \ncustomer behavior and competition for deposits.\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the \nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, \nincluding with respect to deposit betas and forecasts \nof deposit balances, both of which are especially \nsignificant in the case of consumer deposits. The \nresults of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the \nCTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically \nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the \ncomposition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in \nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s \nsimulation and other factors. In the second quarter of \n2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid \nassumptions which take into account observed pricing \nand client and customer behavior during the most \nrecent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates \npaid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, \nresulting in an increase in positive sensitivity in higher \ninterest rate scenarios, and an increase in negative \nsensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures \nof the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s actual \nnet interest income for the rate changes presented \nmay differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios are \nmodelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any \nactions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients or \ncustomers in response to rate changes. Other \nsignificant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk \nscenarios, including mortgage prepayments and \ndeposit rates paid, may also differ from actual results. \nThe Firm’s forecast for net interest income is included \nin the Firm’s outlook on page 57.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n147",

Country \nexposure includes activity with both government and \nprivate-sector entities in a country. \nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management \napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual \ncountry is based on the country where the largest \nproportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, \nobligor or guarantor are located or where the largest \nproportion of its revenue is derived, which may be \ndifferent than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or \ncountry of incorporation. \nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of \nthe Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero \nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or \nguarantors attributed to that country. Activities which \nresult in contingent or indirect exposure to a country \nare not included in the country exposure measure (for \nexample, providing clearing services or secondary \nexposure to collateral on securities financing \nreceivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining \nthe measurement and allocation of country exposure, \nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or index \nproducts, or where the nature of the counterparty, \nissuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for \nattribution to an individual country. The use of \ndifferent measurement approaches or assumptions \ncould affect the amount of reported country exposure.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement \nframework:\n• Deposits with banks are measured as the cash \nbalances placed with central banks, commercial \nbanks, and other financial institutions\n• Lending exposures are measured at the total \ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of \nthe allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and \nmarketable securities collateral received\n• Securities financing exposures are measured at their \nreceivable balance, net of eligible collateral received\n• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair \nvalue of all positions, including both long and short \npositions\n• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is \nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair \nvalue of the eligible collateral received\n• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net \nnotional amount of protection purchased or sold for \nthe same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the \nfair value of the derivative receivable or payable, \nreflecting the manner in which the Firm manages \nthese exposures\nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from \nthe reporting provided under the FFIEC bank \nregulatory requirements.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n150\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

Operational risk is \ninherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself \nin various ways, including fraudulent acts, business \ndisruptions (including those caused by extraordinary \nevents beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, \ninappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply \nwith applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of \nvendors or other third party providers to perform in \naccordance with their agreements. Operational Risk \nManagement attempts to manage operational risk at \nappropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial \nposition, the characteristics of its businesses, and the \nmarkets and regulatory environments in which it \noperates. \nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk \n(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to \nenable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor \nand test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational \nrisk. \nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the \nmanagement of operational risk. The Control \nManagement Organization, which consists of control \nmanagers within each LOB and Corporate, is \nresponsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR \nFramework. \nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) \nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk \nAppetite is responsible for defining the CCOR \nManagement Framework and establishing the \nminimum standards for its execution. The LOB and \nCorporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the \nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and \nQualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the \nrespective businesses or functions they oversee. The \nCCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk \nGovernance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and \napproved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and \nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and \nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of their \nrespective control environment to assess \ncircumstances in which controls have failed, and to \ndetermine where remediation efforts may be required. \nThe Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance \norganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) \nprovides oversight of and challenge to these \nevaluations and may also perform independent \nassessments of significant operational risk events and \nareas of concentrated or emerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an \nindependent assessment of the operational risks \ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which \nincludes evaluating the effectiveness of the control \nenvironments and reporting the results to senior \nmanagement.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses \noperational risks through quantitative means, \nincluding operational risk-based capital and \nestimation of operational risk losses under both \nbaseline and stressed conditions. \nThe primary component of the operational risk-based \ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach \n(“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the \nprojected frequency and severity of operational risk \nlosses based on historical data. The LDA model is used \nto estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a \none-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. \nThe LDA model incorporates actual internal \noperational risk losses in the quarter following the \nperiod in which those losses were realized, and the \ncalculation generally continues to reflect such losses \neven after the issues or business activities giving rise \nto the losses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the \nFirm’s operational risk capital methodology, which \nuses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), \nincorporates internal and external losses as well as \nmanagement’s view of tail risk captured through \noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of \nkey business environment and internal control metrics. \nThe Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its \nAMA estimate of operational risk capital. \nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic \nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a \nforward looking view of material operational risk \nevents that may occur in a stressed environment. The \nFirm’s operational risk stress testing framework is \nutilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and \nother stress testing processes. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 for \ninformation related to operational risk RWA, and \nCCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and Testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by \nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in \nconnection with their independent monitoring and \ntesting compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n153",

Refer to pages 157, 158, 159 and 160, \nrespectively for more information on Compliance, \nConduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. \nDetails on other select examples of operational risks \nsuch as business and technology resiliency, payment \nfraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as \ncybersecurity, are provided below. \nFirmwide resiliency risk \nDisruptions of the Firm’s business and operations can \noccur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as \nthe spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe \nweather, natural disasters, the effects of climate \nchange, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a \nthird party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, \ncivil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firm’s \nresiliency framework is intended to enable the Firm to \nprepare for and adapt to changing conditions and \nwithstand and recover from, and address adverse \neffects on its operations caused by, disruptions that \nmay impact critical business functions and supporting \nassets, including its staff, technology, data and \nfacilities, as well as those of third-party service \nproviders. The framework includes governance, \nawareness training, planning and testing of recovery \nstrategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to \nidentify, assess, and manage resiliency risks. The \nframework operates in accordance with the Firm’s \noverall approach to Operational Risk Management, \nincluding alignment with technology, cybersecurity, \ndata, physical security, crisis management, real estate \nand outsourcing programs.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal \nparties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit \nthrough misdirected or otherwise improper payment. \nThe Firm employs various controls for managing \npayment fraud risk as well as providing employee and \nclient education and awareness trainings.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs \nand Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, \nmonitoring and managing their supplier relationships \nincluding services provided by affiliates. The \nobjectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers \nand other third parties to an appropriate standard of \noperational performance and to mitigate key risks, \nincluding data loss and business disruptions. The \nCorporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible \nfor Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and \nstandards with respect to third-party outsourcing \nrisks.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n154\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

Significant resources are \ndevoted to protecting and enhancing the security of \ncomputer systems, software, networks, storage \ndevices, and other technology. The Firm’s security \nefforts are designed to protect against, among other \nthings, cybersecurity attacks that can result in \nunauthorized access to confidential information, the \ndestruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of \nservice, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. \nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will \ncontinue to experience, a higher volume and \ncomplexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of \nheightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has \nimplemented measures and controls reasonably \ndesigned to address this evolving environment, \nincluding enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the \nFirm continues to review and enhance its capabilities \nto address associated risks, such as those relating to \nthe management of administrative access to systems.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business, that \nfacilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, \nsupply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central \ndepositories, and financial intermediaries) or that the \nFirm has acquired are also sources of cybersecurity \nrisk to the Firm. Third party incidents such as system \nbreakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees \nof such parties, or cyber attacks, including \nransomware and supply-chain compromises, could \nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm, including in \ncircumstances in which an affected third party is \nunable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or \nwhere the incident delivers compromised software to \nthe Firm or results in lost or compromised information \nof the Firm or its clients or customers.\nClients and customers are also sources of \ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information \nassets, particularly when their activities and systems \nare beyond the Firm’s own security and control \nsystems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions \nwith its clients, customers and other external parties \nconcerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities \nto improve cybersecurity.\nRisks from cybersecurity threats, including any \nprevious cybersecurity events, have not materially \naffected the Firm or its business strategy, results of \noperations or financial condition.

      "text": "ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\nEstimations and Model risk, a subcategory of \noperational risk, is the potential for adverse \nconsequences from decisions based on incorrect or \nmisused estimation outputs. \nThe Firm uses models and other analytical and \njudgment-based estimations, including those based \nupon machine learning or artificial intelligence \ntechniques, across various businesses and functions. \nThe estimation methods are of varying levels of \nsophistication and are used for many purposes, such \nas the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, \nassessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting \nstress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit \nlosses and making business decisions. A dedicated \nindependent function, Model Risk Governance and \nReview (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s \npolicies relating to the management of model risk and \nrisks associated with certain analytical and judgment-\nbased estimations, such as those used in risk \nmanagement, budget forecasting and capital planning \nand analysis. \nModel risks are owned by the users of the models \nwithin the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific \npurposes of such models. Users and developers of \nmodels are responsible for developing, implementing \nand testing their models, as well as referring models to \nMRGR for review and approval. Once models have \nbeen approved, model users and developers are \nresponsible for maintaining a robust operating \nenvironment, and must monitor and evaluate the \nperformance of the models on an ongoing basis. \nModel users and developers may seek to enhance \nmodels in response to changes in the relevant \nportfolios and in product and market developments, as \nwell as to capture improvements in available modeling \ntechniques and systems capabilities. \nModels are tiered based on an internal standard \naccording to their complexity, the exposure associated \nwith the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. \nThis tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its \nreview of a model, MRGR considers whether the model \nis suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be \nused. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and \nchallenges the model methodology and the \nreasonableness of model assumptions, and may \nperform or require additional testing, including back-\ntesting of model outcomes. Model reviews are \napproved by the appropriate level of management \nwithin MRGR based on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk \nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new \nmodels, as well as material changes to existing \nmodels, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, \nexceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to \nallow a model to be used prior to review or approval. \nMRGR may also require the user to take appropriate \nactions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in \nthe interim. These actions will depend on the model \nand may include, for example, limitation of trading \nactivity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of \nimprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the \nmarket or economic environment. This is particularly \ntrue when the current and forecasted environments \nare significantly different from the historical \nenvironments upon which the models were developed. \nThis increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater \ndegree of judgment and analytics to inform any \nadjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs \nthan would otherwise be the case.

      "text": "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM \nJPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of \nestimates are integral to understanding its reported \nresults. The Firm’s most complex accounting \nestimates require management’s judgment to \nascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and \nliabilities. The Firm has established policies and \ncontrol procedures intended to ensure that estimation \nmethods, including any judgments made as part of \nsuch methods, are well-controlled, independently \nreviewed and applied consistently from period to \nperiod. The methods used and judgments made \nreflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or \nliabilities and the related business and risk \nmanagement strategies, which may vary across the \nFirm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the \npolicies and procedures are intended to ensure that \nthe process for changing methodologies occurs in an \nappropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates \nfor determining the carrying value of its assets and \nliabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief \ndescription of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates \ninvolving significant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents \nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over \nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial \nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The \nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the \nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n• The allowance for lending-related commitments, \nand\n• The allowance for credit losses on investment \nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant \njudgment on a number of matters including \ndevelopment and weighting of macroeconomic \nforecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, \nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk \nratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination \nof remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note \n13 for further information on these judgments as well \nas the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to \ndetermine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in \nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses \nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to \nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast \nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of \nmacroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant \nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit \nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less than \ntwenty variables. The specific variables that have the \ngreatest effect on the modeled losses vary by portfolio \nand geography.\n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include \nregional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. \nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. \ninterest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil \nprices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. \nHPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of \neconomic conditions could significantly affect its \nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at \nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in \nthe estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm \nrecorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans \nacquired and lending-related commitments assumed \nas of May 1, 2023. Due to differences in risk rating \nmethodologies for the First Republic portfolio and the \nongoing integration of products and systems, the \nallowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale \nportfolio was initially measured based on similar risk \ncharacteristics from other facilities underwritten by \nthe Firm. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, the \nacquired portfolio was incorporated into the Firm's \nmodeled credit loss estimates and is now reflected in \nthe wholesale sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note \n34 for additional information on the First Republic \nacquisition. \nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any \none factor or input might affect the overall allowance \nfor credit losses because management considers a \nwide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the \nallowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and \ninputs considered may not occur at the same rate and \nmay not be consistent across all geographies or \nproduct types, and changes in factors and inputs may \nbe directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in \none factor or input may offset deterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate \nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the \nmodeled credit losses determined using its central \nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which \nare two of the five scenarios considered in estimating \nthe allowances for loan losses and lending-related \ncommitments. The central and relative adverse \nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but \ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of \nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario \nshown on page 137 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative \nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n161",

      "text": "Valuation\nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair \nvalue are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value \nrequires the application of judgment. The type and level \nof judgment required is largely dependent on the \namount of observable market information available to \nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally \ndeveloped valuation models and other valuation \ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs and \nare therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value \nhierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are \nmore significant than those required when estimating \nthe fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 \nand 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument \nwithin level 3, management must first determine the \nappropriate valuation model or other valuation \ntechnique to use. Second, the lack of observability of \ncertain significant inputs requires management to \nassess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation \ninputs including, for example, transaction details, yield \ncurves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default \nrates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as \ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of \ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and \ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of \nthe valuation of level 3 instruments, including \nunobservable inputs used.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, \nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the \nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect \ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, \nmarket funding rates, liquidity considerations, \nunobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet \nspecified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. \nThe judgments made are typically affected by the type \nof product and its specific contractual terms, and the \nlevel of liquidity for the product or within the market as a \nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility and \nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider \nvariation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly \nfor positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a \nfurther discussion of valuation adjustments applied by \nthe Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs \nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss \nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while \nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate \nand consistent with those of other market participants, \nthe methods and assumptions used reflect \nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s \nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions \nin the determination of fair value. The use of \nmethodologies or assumptions different than those \nused by the Firm could result in a different estimate of \nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a \ndetailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and \nhierarchy, and its determination of fair value for \nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to \nreporting units and tested for impairment at least \nannually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to \nconduct goodwill impairment testing is described in \nNote 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing \ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with \neach business combination is allocated to the related \nreporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm \nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated \nmarket cost of equity, as well as actual business results \nand projections of business performance. Based on \nsuch reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was \nnot impaired as of December 31, 2024. For each of the \nreporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at \nleast 10% and there was no indication of a significant \nrisk of goodwill impairment based on current \nprojections and valuations. \nThe projections for the Firm’s reporting units are \nconsistent with management’s current business outlook \nassumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best \nestimates of long-term growth and return on equity in \nthe longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-\nparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and \nestimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, \nincluding the goodwill impairment assessment as of \nDecember 31, 2024.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorganChase offers credit cards with various \nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn \nrewards points based on their account activity and the \nterms and conditions of the rewards program. \nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that an \neligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, \nand the points can be redeemed for a variety of \nrewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of \naccount credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm \nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the \nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected \nto be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued \nas the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when \nthe cardholder redeems points. This liability was $14.4 \nbillion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and \nother liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The \nincrease in the liability was driven by continued growth \nin rewards points earned on higher spend and \npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout \n2024.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate \n(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions.

      "text": "assumption is used to estimate the number of points \nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the life \nof the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate \nthe cost of future point redemptions. These \nassumptions are evaluated periodically considering \nhistorical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and \nmanagement judgment. Updates to these assumptions \nwill impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, \n2024, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and \n1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability \nby approximately $442 million.\nIncome taxes \nJPMorganChase is subject to the income tax laws of the \nvarious jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. \nfederal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. \nThese laws are often complex and may be subject to \ndifferent interpretations. To determine the financial \nstatement impact of accounting for income taxes, \nincluding the provision for income tax expense and \nunrecognized tax benefits, JPMorganChase must make \nassumptions and judgments about how to interpret and \napply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions \nand business events, as well as make judgments \nregarding the timing of when certain items may affect \ntaxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\nJPMorganChase’s interpretations of tax laws around the \nworld are subject to review and examination by the \nvarious taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the \nFirm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its \nview on a tax position. These disputes over \ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities may \nbe settled by audit, administrative appeals or \nadjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions \nin which the Firm operates. JPMorganChase regularly \nreviews whether it may be assessed additional income \ntaxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and \nthe Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, \nas appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its \nestimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax \nlaws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is \npossible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income \ntaxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of \noperations in any reporting period.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets \nand liabilities measured for financial reporting versus \nincome tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are \nrecognized if, in management’s judgment, their \nrealizability is determined to be more likely than not. \nDeferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates \nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in \nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be \nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a \nchange in tax rates is recognized within the provision \nfor income taxes in the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in \nconnection with certain tax attributes, including net \noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax \ncredit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular \nreviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are \nrealizable. These reviews include management’s \nestimates and assumptions regarding future taxable \nincome, including foreign source income, and may \nincorporate various tax planning strategies, including \nstrategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and \nFTCs before they expire. In connection with these \nreviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is \nnot realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The \nvaluation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent \nreporting period if the Firm determines that, based on \nrevised estimates of future taxable income or changes \nin tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that \nall or part of the deferred tax asset will become \nrealizable. As of December 31, 2024, management has \ndetermined it is more likely than not that the Firm will \nrealize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing \nvaluation allowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as \nnecessary when new information becomes available, \nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and \ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax \npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not \nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the \namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit \nthat management believes is more likely than not to be \nrealized upon settlement. It is possible that the \nreassessment of JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax \nbenefits may have a material impact on its effective \nincome tax rate in the period in which the reassessment \noccurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates \nare reasonable, the final tax amount could be different \nfrom the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax \nprovisions and accruals. To the extent that the final \noutcome of these amounts is different than the amounts \nrecorded, such differences will generally impact the \nFirm’s provision for income taxes in the period in which \nsuch a determination is made.\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of \ncurrent and deferred taxes. The current and deferred \ntax provisions are calculated based on estimates and \nassumptions that could differ from the actual results \nreflected in income tax returns filed during the \nsubsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns \nare generally recorded in the period when the tax \nreturns are filed and the global tax implications are \nknown, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate.\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income \ntaxes.\nLitigation reserves \nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant \nestimates and judgments associated with establishing \nlitigation reserves.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\n164\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

Also in our opinion, the Firm \nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, \n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – \nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \nBasis for Opinions\nThe Firm’s management is responsible for these \nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining \neffective internal control over financial reporting, and for \nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control \nover financial reporting, included in the accompanying \nManagement’s report on internal control over financial \nreporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on \nthe Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the \nFirm’s internal control over financial reporting based on \nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered \nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Firm in accordance with \nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the \nstandards of the PCAOB.

We believe \nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our \nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over \nFinancial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a \nprocess designed to provide reasonable assurance \nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the \npreparation of financial statements for external \npurposes in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting includes those policies and \nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of \nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly \nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of \nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that \ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that \nreceipts and expenditures of the company are being \nmade only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and \n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention \nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of \neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk \nthat controls may become inadequate because of \nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance \nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  •  300 Madison Avenue  •  New York, NY 10017\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n169",

      "text": "Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are \nmatters arising from the current period audit of the \nconsolidated financial statements that were \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the \naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated \nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially \nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The \ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter \nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial \nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by \ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, \nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit \nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which \nthey relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based \ncomponent of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan \nPortfolios \nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial \nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the \nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and \ncredit card loan portfolios was $22.0 billion on total \nportfolio-based retained loans of $919.3 billion at \nDecember 31, 2024. The Firm’s allowance for loan \nlosses represents management’s estimate of expected \ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of the \nFirm's loan portfolios and considers expected future \nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-\nbased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan \nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan \nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of \nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the \nloan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated \nexposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are \ndetermined based on the weighted average of five \ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that \ntake into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as \nderived through forecast macroeconomic variables, \nthe most significant of which are U.S. unemployment \nand U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative \ncalculation is further adjusted to take into \nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk \nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that \nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss \nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that \nperforming procedures relating to the allowance for \nloan losses for the portfolio-based component of the \nwholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical \naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment and \nestimation by management in the forecast of \nmacroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. \nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, \nas the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions \nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit \nlosses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant \njudgment and estimation by management in \ndetermining the quantitative calculation utilized in \ntheir credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take \ninto consideration model imprecision, emerging risk \nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that \nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss \nestimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor \njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing \nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained \nrelating to the credit loss estimates and the \nappropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss \nestimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of \nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing \nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in \nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the \nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures \nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls relating \nto the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including \ncontrols over model validation and generation of \nmacroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also \nincluded, among others, testing management’s \nprocess for estimating the allowance for loan losses, \nwhich involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of \nthe models and methodologies used in quantitative \ncalculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of \nforecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross \ndomestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and \naccuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) \nevaluating the reasonableness of management’s \nadjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts \nof model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, \ntrends and other subjective factors that are not yet \notherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These \nprocedures also included the use of professionals with \nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating \nthe appropriateness of certain models, methodologies \nand macroeconomic variables.\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.5 trillion of its \nassets and $586.2 billion of its liabilities at fair value on \na recurring basis. Included in these balances are $10.9 \nbillion of trading assets and $51.8 billion of liabilities \nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively \nfinancial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as \nthey contain one or more inputs to valuation which are \nunobservable and significant to their fair value \nmeasurement. The Firm utilized internally developed \nvaluation models and unobservable inputs to estimate \nfair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The \nunobservable inputs used by management to estimate \nthe fair value of certain of these financial instruments \ninclude interest rate volatility, equity volatility, \nBermudan switch value and correlation relating to \ninterest rates, interest rate-to-foreign exchange, \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n170\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "Note 1 – Basis of presentation\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the \n“Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated \nunder Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial \nservices firm based in the U.S., with operations \nworldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, \nfinancial services for consumers and small businesses, \ncommercial banking, financial transaction processing \nand asset management. Refer to Note 32 for further \ndiscussion of the Firm's reportable business \nsegments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of \nJPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. \nGAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies \nconform to the accounting and reporting guidelines \nprescribed by regulatory authorities.\nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the \naccounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in \nwhich the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All \nmaterial intercompany balances and transactions have \nbeen eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary \ncapacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase \nand are not included on the Consolidated balance \nsheets.\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling \nfinancial interest in an entity by first evaluating \nwhether the entity is a voting interest entity or a \nvariable interest entity. \nVoting interest entities\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient \nequity and provide the equity investors voting rights \nthat enable them to make significant decisions relating \nto the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, \nthe Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling \ninterest is primarily based on the amount of voting \nequity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a \ncontrolling financial interest, through ownership of the \nmajority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or \nthrough other contractual rights that give the Firm \ncontrol, are consolidated by the Firm.\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has \nsignificant influence over operating and financing \ndecisions (but does not own a majority of the voting \nequity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance \nwith the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair \nvalue if the fair value option was elected. These \ninvestments are generally included in other assets, \nwith income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are \nstructured as limited partnerships or limited liability \ncompanies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the \ngeneral partner or managing member, but the non-\naffiliated partners or members have the ability to \nremove the Firm as the general partner or managing \nmember without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on \na simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or \nmembers have rights to participate in important \ndecisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate \nthese voting interest entities. However, in the limited \ncases where the non-managing partners or members \ndo not have substantive kick-out or participating \nrights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and \nconsolidates the funds if the Firm is the general \npartner or managing member and has both power and \na potentially significant interest. \nThe Firm’s investment companies and asset \nmanagement funds have investments in both publicly-\nheld and privately-held entities, including investments \nin buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. \nThese investments are accounted for under \ninvestment company guidelines and, accordingly, \nirrespective of the percentage of equity ownership \ninterests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance \nsheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, \nwith income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If \nconsolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under \nsuch specialized investment company guidelines.\nVariable interest entities \nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack \nsufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its \nactivities without additional subordinated financial \nsupport from other parties, or (2) have equity investors \nthat do not have the ability to make significant \ndecisions relating to the entity’s operations through \nvoting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb \nthe expected losses, or do not have the right to receive \nthe residual returns of the entity.\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are \ncommonly used in securitization transactions in order \nto isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows \nfrom those assets to investors. The basic SPE \nstructure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; \nthe SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing \nsecurities to investors. The legal documents that \ngovern the transaction specify how the cash earned on \nthe assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors \nand other parties that have rights to those cash flows. \nSPEs are generally structured to insulate investors \nfrom claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other \nentities, including the creditors of the seller of the \nassets. \nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has \na controlling financial interest) is required to \nconsolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE.

This assessment includes, first, \nidentifying the activities that most significantly impact \nthe VIE’s economic performance; and second, \nidentifying which party, if any, has power over those \nactivities. In general, the parties that make the most \nsignificant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset \nmanagers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of \ncall options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) \nor have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-\nmakers are deemed to have the power to direct the \nactivities of a VIE.\nTo assess whether the Firm has the obligation to \nabsorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits \nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the \nVIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, \nincluding debt and equity investments, servicing fees, \nand derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be \nvariable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires \nthat the Firm apply judgment in determining whether \nthese interests, in the aggregate, are considered \npotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in \nassessing significance include: the design of the VIE, \nincluding its capitalization structure; subordination of \ninterests; payment priority; relative share of interests \nheld across various classes within the VIE’s capital \nstructure; and the reasons why the interests are held \nby the Firm.\nThe Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) \nwhether entities previously evaluated under the \nmajority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, \nbased on certain events, and are therefore subject to \nthe VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether \nchanges in the facts and circumstances regarding the \nFirm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s \nconsolidation conclusion to change.\nRefer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-\nsponsored VIEs.\nRevenue recognition \nInterest income \nThe Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt \nsecurities, and other debt instruments, generally on a \nlevel-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual \nrate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.\nRevenue from contracts with customers \nJPMorganChase recognizes noninterest revenue from \ncertain contracts with customers, in investment \nbanking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management \nfees, commissions and other fees, and components of \ncard income, when the Firm’s related performance \nobligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further \ndiscussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with \ncustomers. \nPrincipal transactions revenue \nJPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and \nliabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are \nreported primarily in principal transactions revenue. \nRefer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair \nvalue measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further \ndiscussion of principal transactions revenue. \nUse of estimates in the preparation of consolidated \nfinancial statements\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial \nStatements requires management to make estimates \nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of \nassets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and \ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual \nresults could be different from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation\nJPMorganChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue \nand expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into \nU.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.\nGains and losses relating to translating functional \ncurrency financial statements for U.S. reporting are \nincluded in the Consolidated statements of \ncomprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to \nnonfunctional currency transactions, including non-\nU.S. operations where the functional currency is the \nU.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated \nstatements of income.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative \nreceivables and derivative payables with the same \ncounterparty and the related cash collateral \nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the \nConsolidated balance sheets when a legally \nenforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. \nGAAP also permits securities sold and purchased \nunder repurchase agreements and securities \nborrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements \nto be presented net when specified conditions are met, \nincluding the existence of a legally enforceable master \nnetting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such \nbalances where it has determined that the specified \nconditions are met.\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate \ncounterparty credit risk in certain transactions, \nincluding derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, \nsecurities borrowed and securities loaned \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n178\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

A master netting agreement is a single \nagreement with a counterparty that permits multiple \ntransactions governed by that agreement to be \nterminated or accelerated and settled through a single \npayment in a single currency in the event of a default \n(e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment \nor securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin \nwhen due). Upon the exercise of derivatives \ntermination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all \ntransactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are \nvalued and the positive values of “in the money” \ntransactions are netted against the negative values of \n“out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only \nremaining payment obligation is of one of the parties \nto pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise \nof default rights under repurchase agreements and \nsecurities loan agreements in general (i) all \ntransactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all \nvalues of securities or cash held or to be delivered are \ncalculated, and all such sums are netted against each \nother and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is \nof one of the parties to pay the netted termination \namount.\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of \ntransactions also often contain a collateral/margin \nagreement that provides for a security interest in, or \ntitle transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to \nthe party that has the right to demand margin (the \n“demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement \ntypically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin \nto the demanding party with a value equal to the \namount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all \ntransactions governed by the master netting \nagreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin \nagreement grants to the demanding party, upon \ndefault by the counterparty, the right to set-off any \namounts payable by the counterparty against any \nposted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted \ncollateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding \nparty the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to \napply the proceeds to an amount payable by the \ncounterparty.\nRefer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s \nderivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further \ndiscussion of the Firm’s securities financing \nagreements. \nStatements of cash flows\nFor JPMorganChase’s Consolidated statements of \ncash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included \nin cash and due from banks and deposits with banks \non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounting standard adopted January 1, 2024\nEquity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for \nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures Using the \nProportional Amortization Method \nThe guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented \ninvestments, beyond affordable housing tax credit \ninvestments, that the Firm can elect on a program by \nprogram basis, to be accounted for using the \nproportional amortization method. This method \nrequires the cost of eligible investments, within an \nelected program, to be amortized in proportion to the \ntax benefits received with the resulting amortization \nreported directly in income tax expense, which aligns \nwith the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. \nEligible investments must meet certain criteria, \nincluding that substantially all of the return is from \nincome tax credits and other income tax benefits.\nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under \nthe modified retrospective method. The adoption of \nthis guidance resulted in a change to the classification \nand timing of the amortization associated with certain \nof the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented \ninvestments. As a result of the adoption, the \namortization of these investments that was previously \nrecognized in other income is now recognized in \nincome tax expense. The change in accounting \nresulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $161 \nmillion and increased the Firm’s income tax expense \nand the effective tax rate by approximately $450 \nmillion and two percentage points, respectively, in the \nfirst quarter of 2024, with no material impact to net \nincome.\nThe guidance requires additional disclosure for all \ninvestments that generate income tax credits and \nother income tax benefits from a tax-oriented \ninvestment program for which the Firm has elected to \napply the proportional amortization method. The \nguidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible \ninvestments when significant modifications or events \noccur that result in a change in the nature of the \ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship with \nthe underlying project.\nRefer to Notes 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.\nAccounting standards adopted January 1, 2023\nDerivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – \nPortfolio Layer Method\nThe adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to \nhedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets in a qualifying \nhedge accounting relationship. As permitted by the \nguidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities \nto AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio \nlayer method hedge upon adoption.

      "text": "Note 2 – Fair value measurement\nJPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and \nliabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are \npredominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis \n(i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and \nreported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated \nbalance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and \nunfunded lending-related commitments are measured \nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are \nnot measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are \nsubject to fair value adjustments only in certain \ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of \nimpairment).\nFair value is defined as the price that would be \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in \nan orderly transaction between market participants at \nthe measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted \nmarket prices or inputs, where available. If prices or \nquotes are not available, fair value is based on \nvaluation models and other valuation techniques that \nconsider relevant transaction characteristics (such as \nmaturity) and use, as inputs, observable or \nunobservable market parameters, including yield \ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as \ncommodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, \nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value \nmay also incorporate valuation adjustments. \nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable \nmarket inputs or other factors can affect the amount of \ngain or loss recorded for a particular position. \nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation \nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those of \nother market participants, the methods and \nassumptions used reflect management judgment and \nmay vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and \nassumptions in the determination of fair value. The use \nof different methodologies or assumptions by other \nmarket participants compared with those used by the \nFirm could result in the Firm deriving a different \nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. \nValuation process \nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair \nvalue estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the \nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s \nValuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the \nFirm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-\ntaking functions, is responsible for verifying these \nestimates and determining any fair value adjustments \nthat may be required to ensure that the Firm’s \npositions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the \nFirm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is \ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives, is \nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks \narising from valuation activities conducted across the \nFirm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide \nhead of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s \nController), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, \nCCB, AWM and certain corporate functions including \nTreasury and CIO. \nPrice verification process \nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the \nrisk-taking functions by leveraging independently \nderived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, \nwhere available. Where independent prices or inputs \nare not available, the VCG performs additional review \nto ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The \nadditional review may include evaluating the limited \nmarket activity including client unwinds, \nbenchmarking valuation inputs to those used for \nsimilar instruments, decomposing the valuation of \nstructured instruments into individual components, \ncomparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing \nprofit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in \ncollateral valuation. There are also additional levels of \nmanagement review for more significant or complex \npositions.\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that \nmay be required to the estimates provided by the risk-\ntaking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are \napplied for instruments classified within level 1 of the \nfair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion of the fair \nvalue hierarchy on page 182 for further information). \nFor other positions, judgment is required to assess the \nneed for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect \nliquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, \nand, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, \nthe size of the net open risk position. The \ndetermination of such adjustments follows a \nconsistent framework across the Firm:\n• Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered \nwhere an observable external price or valuation \nparameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially \ndue to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation \nadjustments are made based on current market \nconditions. Factors that may be considered in \ndetermining the liquidity adjustment include \nanalysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the \ninstrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing \npoints for similar instruments in active markets; and \n(3) the range of reasonable values that the price or \nparameter could take. \n• The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial \ninstruments on the basis of net open risk exposure \nand, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to \nestimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis \nof a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an \norderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation \nadjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of \nexiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open \nrisk position. Where applied, such adjustments are \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n181",

Adjustments are made to \nreflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting \nvaluation estimate. \n• Where appropriate, the Firm also applies \nadjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to \nappropriately reflect counterparty credit quality \n(CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and \nthe impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent \nframework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and \nfunding adjustments on page 198 of this Note for \nmore information on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval \nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument \nor a similar instrument, fair value is generally \ndetermined using valuation models that consider \nrelevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as \ninputs market-based or independently sourced \nparameters. Where this is the case the price \nverification process described above is applied to the \ninputs in those models. \nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk \nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new \nmodels, as well as material changes to existing \nmodels, prior to implementation in the operating \nenvironment. In certain circumstances exceptions may \nbe granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be \nused prior to review or approval. MRGR may also \nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate \nthe model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These \nactions will depend on the model and may include, for \nexample, limitation of trading activity. \nFair value hierarchy \nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established \nunder U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value \nmeasurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on \nthe observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset \nor liability as of the measurement date. The three \nlevels are defined as follows. \n• Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are \nquoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or \nliabilities in active markets. \n• Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology \ninclude quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities \nin active markets, and inputs that are observable for \nthe asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for \nsubstantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n• Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation \nmethodology are unobservable and significant to the \nfair value measurement. \nA financial instrument’s categorization within the fair \nvalue hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input \nthat is significant to the fair value measurement.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n182\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term \ndefined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities \ninventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the \nFirm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying \nvalue of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in \nfair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure \ninformation, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n187\nFair value hierarchy Level 2 \nFair value hierarchy Level 3",

      "text": "Level 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for \ndetermining fair value, including for instruments where \nfair value is estimated using significant unobservable \ninputs (level 3). Refer to pages 181–185 of this Note for \nfurther information on the Firm’s valuation process and \na detailed discussion of the determination of fair value \nfor individual financial instruments. \nEstimating fair value requires the application of \njudgment. The type and level of judgment required is \nlargely dependent on the amount of observable market \ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments \nvalued using internally developed valuation models and \nother valuation techniques that use significant \nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within \nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to \nestimate fair value are more significant than those \nrequired when estimating the fair value of instruments \nclassified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument \nwithin level 3, management must first determine the \nappropriate valuation model or other valuation \ntechnique to use. Second, due to the lack of \nobservability of significant inputs, management must \nassess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation \ninputs including transaction details, yield curves, \ninterest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, \nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, \nequity or debt prices), valuations of comparable \ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 \nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to \nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, \nthe significant unobservable inputs, the range of values \nfor those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic \naverages of such inputs. While the determination to \nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the \nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall \nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments \ntypically include observable components (that is, \ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be \nvalidated to external sources) in addition to the \nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 \ninputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm \nmanages the risk of the observable components of level \n3 financial instruments using securities and derivative \npositions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy. \nThe range of values presented in the table is \nrepresentative of the highest and lowest level input \nused to value the significant groups of instruments \nwithin a product/instrument classification. Where \nprovided, the weighted averages of the input values \npresented in the table are calculated based on the fair \nvalue of the instruments that the input is being used to \nvalue. \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and \narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of \ninput uncertainty or an assessment of the \nreasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and \nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of \nthe various instruments held by the Firm and the \nrelative distribution of instruments within the range of \ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may \nhave similar levels of market risk exposure and \nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly \ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option \ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike \nprices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic \naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the \ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at \neach balance sheet date. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n189",

      "text": "Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs \nThe following discussion provides a description of the \nimpact on a fair value measurement of a change in each \nunobservable input in isolation, and the \ninterrelationship between unobservable inputs, where \nrelevant and significant. The impact of changes in \ninputs may not be independent, as a change in one \nunobservable input may give rise to a change in another \nunobservable input. Where relationships do exist \nbetween two unobservable inputs, those relationships \nare discussed below. Relationships may also exist \nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for \nexample, as observable interest rates rise, \nunobservable prepayment rates decline); such \nrelationships have not been included in the discussion \nbelow. In addition, for each of the individual \nrelationships described below, the inverse relationship \nwould also generally apply. \nThe following discussion also provides a description of \nattributes of the underlying instruments and external \nmarket factors that affect the range of inputs used in \nthe valuation of the Firm’s positions. \nYield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to \ndiscount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow \ncalculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would \nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. \nCredit spread – The credit spread is the amount of \nadditional annualized return over the market interest \nrate that a market participant would demand for taking \nexposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit \nspread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate \nused in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, \nan increase in the credit spread would result in a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular \nmortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk \ninherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by \nthe absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument \n(which may not correspond directly to the level of \ninherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit \nspreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various \ninstruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in \nmortgage-backed securities is driven by the \nsubordination of the security being valued and the \ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the \ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, \nLTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of \nthe property and/or any tenants for commercial \nmortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of \nU.S. states and municipalities and other similar \ninstruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of \nthe obligor and the tenor of the obligation. \nPrepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a \nmeasure of the voluntary unscheduled principal \nrepayments of a prepayable obligation in a \ncollateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally \ndecline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in \nprepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued \nat a premium to par and an increase in a fair value \nmeasurement of assets valued at a discount to par. \nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to \ncollateral pool, and are driven by the type and location \nof the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of \nthe obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or \nfloating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. \nTypically collateral pools with higher borrower credit \nquality have a higher prepayment rate than those with \nlower borrower credit quality, all other factors being \nequal. \nConditional default rate – The conditional default rate is \na measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral \nbalance underlying a collateralized obligation as a \nresult of defaults. While there is typically no direct \nrelationship between conditional default rates and \nprepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which \nthe underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds \nwill tend to have lower conditional default rates. An \nincrease in conditional default rates would generally be \naccompanied by an increase in loss severity and an \nincrease in credit spreads. An increase in the \nconditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional \ndefault rates reflect the quality of the collateral \nunderlying a securitization and the structure of the \nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities \nowned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, \nconditional default rates are most typically at the lower \nend of the range presented. \nLoss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is \nthe recovery rate) is the expected amount of future \nrealized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of \na particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss \nrelative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in \nloss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in \nconditional default rates. An increase in the loss \nseverity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair \nvalue measurement. \nThe loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed \nsecurity depends on factors relating to the underlying \nmortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the \nlender’s lien on the property and other instrument-\nspecific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n191",

      "text": "Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the \nrelationship between the movements of two variables. \nCorrelation is a pricing input for a derivative product \nwhere the payoff is driven by one or more underlying \nrisks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of \nderivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign \nexchange and commodity) due to the nature of the \nunderlying risks. When parameters are positively \ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in an \nincrease in the other parameter. When parameters are \nnegatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will \nresult in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase \nin correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a \nfair value measurement. Given a short correlation \nposition, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would \ngenerally result in a decrease in a fair value \nmeasurement.\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of \nderivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a \nnumber of factors including the nature of those risks. \nFor example, the correlation between two credit risk \nexposures would be different than that between two \ninterest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the \ntransaction may also impact the correlation input, as \nthe relationship between the underlying risks may be \ndifferent over different time periods. Furthermore, \ncorrelation levels are dependent on market conditions \nand could have a relatively wide range of levels within or \nacross asset classes over time, particularly in volatile \nmarket conditions. \nVolatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in \npossible returns for an instrument, parameter or market \nindex given how much the particular instrument, \nparameter or index changes in value over time. \nVolatility is a pricing input for options, including equity \noptions, commodity options, and interest rate options. \nGiven a long position in an option, an increase in \nvolatility, in isolation, would generally result in an \nincrease in a fair value measurement. \nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular \noption-based derivative depends on a number of \nfactors, including the nature of the risk underlying the \noption (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security \nmay be significantly different from that of a particular \ncommodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as \nthe strike price of the option. \nBermudan switch value – The switch value is the \ndifference between the overall value of a Bermudan \nswaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in \ntime, and its most expensive European swaption and \nreflects the additional value that the multiple exercise \ndates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent \non market conditions and can vary greatly depending \non a number of factors, such as the tenor of the \nunderlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. \nAn increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally \nresult in an increase in a fair value measurement.\nInterest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents \nthe relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. \nThe interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and \nforeign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a \npricing input used in the discounting of any derivative \ncash flow.  \nForward price – The forward price is the price at which \nthe buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a \nforward contract on the predetermined future delivery \ndate, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at \ninception. \nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of \ncertain derivatives and depends on a number of factors \nincluding interest rates, the current price of the \nunderlying asset, and the expected income to be \nreceived and costs to be incurred by the seller as a \nresult of holding that asset until the delivery date. An \nincrease in the forward can result in an increase or a \ndecrease in a fair value measurement. \nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements \nThe following tables include a rollforward of the \nConsolidated balance sheets amounts (including \nchanges in fair value) for financial instruments classified \nby the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for \nthe years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nWhen a determination is made to classify a financial \ninstrument within level 3, the determination is based on \nthe significance of the unobservable inputs to the \noverall fair value measurement. However, level 3 \nfinancial instruments typically include, in addition to the \nunobservable or level 3 components, observable \ncomponents (that is, components that are actively \nquoted and can be validated to external sources); \naccordingly, the gains and losses in the table below \ninclude changes in fair value due in part to observable \nfactors that are part of the valuation methodology. The \nFirm risk-manages the observable components of level \n3 financial instruments using securities and derivative \npositions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk \nmanagement instruments are not included below, the \ngains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the \neffect of the Firm’s risk management activities related \nto such level 3 instruments.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n192\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives\nDerivatives are generally valued using models that use \nas their basis observable market parameters. These \nmarket parameters generally do not consider factors \nsuch as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s \nown credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is \ngenerally necessary to make adjustments to the base \nestimate of fair value to reflect these factors.\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the \nrelevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect \ncounterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm \nestimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate \nthe expected positive credit exposure across all of the \nFirm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and \nthen estimates losses based on the probability of \ndefault and estimated recovery rate as a result of a \ncounterparty credit event considering contractual \nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit \nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. \nThe key inputs to this methodology are (i) the \nprobability of a default event occurring for each \ncounterparty, as derived from observed or estimated \nCDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied \nby CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences \nin recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to \nthose reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect \nsenior unsecured creditor risk.\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of \nfunding and is recognized where there is evidence that \na market participant in the principal market would \nincorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The \nFirm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized \n(including partially collateralized) over-the-counter \n(“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) \nthe expected funding requirements arising from the \nFirm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral \narrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding \ncost in the principal market which, for derivative \nliabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For \ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by \ndiscounting expected future cash flows at the relevant \novernight indexed swap rate given the underlying \ncollateral agreement with the counterparty, and \ntherefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and \nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue \nin the respective periods, excluding the effect of any \nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented \nbelow includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit \nquality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the \nimpact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over \ntime.\nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA\n$ \n29 \n$ \n221 \n$ \n22 \nDerivatives FVA\n \n99 \n \n114 \n \n42 \nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected \nliabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair \nvalue option has been elected requires consideration \nof the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option \nelected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the \nissuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of \ndefault and LGD, which are estimated based on \nchanges in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the \nbond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for \nfair value option elected liabilities are reported in \nprincipal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/\nlosses are reported in OCI.

On May 6, \n2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2 million Visa B-1 shares in exchange \nfor a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in an initial gain of \n$8.0 billion based on the fair value of the Visa C shares. In addition, the second quarter of 2024 also reflected other \nVisa-related activity, including the fair value changes of the Visa C shares and derivative instruments, as well as \ndividends, resulting in the $7.9 billion net gain on Visa shares in the quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Firm had \ndisposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales in the second and third quarters of 2024  and through a $1.0 billion \ncontribution to the Firm’s Foundation in the second quarter of 2024. \nThe Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares \n(“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The \nconversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was  1.5430 at December 31, 2024  and may be adjusted by Visa \ndepending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect \nthat the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, \n2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated \nand what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as \ndifferences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their \nnominal carryover basis. \nSeparately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments \nwith the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion \nrate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent \nchanges in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The \npayments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B-2 shares associated with the \npreviously sold Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at \nfair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of \nfinal resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in \nfair value are recognized in other income. The notional amount of shares associated with those derivative \ninstruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm held \nderivative instruments associated with 11.6 million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which \nare all subject to similar terms and conditions. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n200\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of \nthe underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s \nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is \ngenerally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect \nthe fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.  \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n201\nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 1 \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 1 \nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 1 \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 1 \nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 2 \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 2 \nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 2 \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 2 \nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 3 \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 3 \nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 3 \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Level 3 \nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Total estimated fair value \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Total estimated fair value \nDecember 31, 2024 Estimated fair value hierarchy Total estimated fair value \nDecember 31, 2023 Estimated fair value hierarchy Total estimated fair value",

      "text": "Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for \nitems for which the fair value option was elected \nThe following describes how the gains and losses that \nare attributable to changes in instrument-specific \ncredit risk, were determined. \n• Loans and lending-related commitments: For \nfloating-rate instruments, all changes in value are \nattributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For \nfixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes \nin value for the period is made between those \nchanges in value that are interest rate-related and \nchanges in value that are credit-related. Allocations \nare generally based on an analysis of borrower-\nspecific credit spread and recovery information, \nwhere available, or benchmarking to similar entities \nor industries. \n• Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to \ninstrument-specific credit risk were derived \nprincipally from observable changes in the Firm’s \ncredit spread as observed in the bond market. \n• Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these \ntypes of agreements, there is a requirement that \ncollateral be maintained with a market value equal to \nor in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a \nresult, there would be no adjustment or an \nimmaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit \nrisk related to these agreements. \nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding \nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining \ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for loans, long-term debt and long-\nterm beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. \n2024 Contractual principal outstanding \n2023 Fair value over/(under) contractual principal outstanding \nDecember 31, (in millions)\n2024 Contrac\ntual princ\nipal outstanding \n2024 Fair value \n2024 Fair value \nover/(un\nder) contrac\ntual princ\nipal outstanding \n2023 Contrac\ntual princ\nipal outstanding \n2023 Fair value \n2023 Fair v\nalue over/(un\nder) contrac\ntual princ\nipal outstanding \nLoans\nNonaccrual loans\nLoans reported as trading assets\n$ \n3,429 \n$ \n464 $ \n(2,965) $ \n2,987 \n$ \n588 $ \n(2,399) \nLoans\n \n1,711 \n \n1,492  \n(219)  \n838 \n \n732  \n(106) \nSubtotal\n \n5,140 \n \n1,956  \n(3,184)  \n3,825 \n \n1,320  \n(2,505) \n90 or more days past due and \ngovernment guaranteed\nLoans\n(a)\n \n50 \n \n45  \n(5)  \n65 \n \n59  \n(6) \nAll other performing loans\n(b)\nLoans reported as trading assets\n \n12,171 \n \n10,852  \n(1,319)  \n9,547 \n \n7,968  \n(1,579) \nLoans\n(c)\n \n40,342 \n \n39,813  \n(529)  \n38,948 \n \n38,060  \n(888) \nSubtotal\n \n52,513 \n \n50,665  \n(1,848)  \n48,495 \n \n46,028  \n(2,467) \nTotal loans\n$ \n57,703 \n$ \n52,666 $ \n(5,037) $ \n52,385 \n$ \n47,407 $ \n(4,978) \nLong-term debt\nPrincipal-protected debt\n$ \n57,414 \n(e)\n$ \n47,780 $ \n(9,634) $ \n47,768 \n(e)\n$ \n38,882 $ \n(8,886) \nNonprincipal-protected debt\n(d)\nNA\n \n53,000 \nNA\nNA\n \n49,042 \nNA\nTotal long-term debt\nNA\n$ 100,780 \nNA\nNA\n$ \n87,924 \nNA\nLong-term beneficial interests\nNonprincipal-protected debt\n(d)\nNA\n$ \n1 \nNA\nNA\n$ \n1 \nNA\nTotal long-term beneficial interests\nNA\n$ \n1 \nNA\nNA\n$ \n1 \nNA\n(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.\n(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due.\n(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests.

      "text": "Note 5 – Derivative instruments \nDerivative contracts derive their value from underlying \nasset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a \ncombination of these factors and may expose \ncounterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying \nasset or liability without having to initially invest in, own \nor exchange the asset or liability. JPMorganChase \nmakes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses \nderivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. \nPredominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered \ninto for market-making or risk management purposes. \nMarket-making derivatives \nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into \nfor market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to \nmitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign \nexchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm \nactively manages the risks from its exposure to these \nderivatives by entering into other derivative contracts \nor by purchasing or selling other financial instruments \nthat partially or fully offset the exposure from client \nderivatives. \nRisk management derivatives \nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk \nexposures using derivative instruments, including \nderivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other \nderivatives that are used to manage risks associated \nwith specified assets and liabilities. \nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to \nmanage the risk associated with changes in interest \nrates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or \ndepreciate in market value as interest rates change. \nSimilarly, interest income and expense increase or \ndecrease as a result of variable-rate assets and \nliabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a \nresult of the repayment and subsequent origination or \nissuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current \nmarket rates. Gains and losses on the derivative \ninstruments related to these assets and liabilities are \nexpected to substantially offset this variability. \nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the \nforeign exchange risk associated with certain foreign \ncurrency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and \nliabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the \nFirm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries \nor branches whose functional currencies are not the \nU.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign \ncurrencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the \nforeign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or \nthe forecasted revenues or expenses increase or \ndecrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments \nrelated to these foreign currency–denominated assets \nor liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to \nsubstantially offset this variability. \nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price \nrisk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses \non these derivative instruments are expected to \nsubstantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of \nthe related inventory. \nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty \ncredit risk associated with loans and lending-related \ncommitments. Credit derivatives compensate the \npurchaser when the entity referenced in the contract \nexperiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a \nfailure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives \nprimarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives \nsection on pages 222–224 of this Note for a further \ndiscussion of credit derivatives. \nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and \nlosses table on page 221 and the hedge accounting \ngains and losses tables on pages 218–221 of this Note \nfor more information about risk management \nderivatives. \nDerivative counterparties and settlement types \nThe Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are \nnegotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative \ncounterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, \ncertain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts \nare generally standardized contracts traded on an \nexchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s \ncounterparty from the inception of the transactions. \nOTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis \nand then novated to the CCP for clearing. \nDerivative clearing services \nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which \nthe Firm acts as a clearing member at certain \nexchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not \nreflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its \nConsolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for \nfurther information on the Firm’s clearing services. \nAccounting for derivatives \nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for \nits own account are required to be recorded on the \nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. \nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative \nassets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral \nreceivables and payables, when a legally enforceable \nmaster netting agreement exists between the Firm and \nthe derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further \ndiscussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The \naccounting for changes in value of a derivative depends \non whether or not the transaction has been designated \nand qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are \nnot designated as hedges are reported and measured \nat fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures \non pages 213–221 of this Note provide additional \ninformation on the amount of, and reporting for, \nderivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses.

      "text": "Derivatives designated as hedges \nThe Firm applies hedge accounting to certain \nderivatives executed for risk management purposes – \ngenerally interest rate, foreign exchange and \ncommodity derivatives. However, JPMorganChase \ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the \nderivatives associated with the Firm’s risk \nmanagement activities. For example, the Firm does \nnot apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to \nmanage the credit risk of loans and lending-related \ncommitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying \nsuch contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the \nFirm does not apply hedge accounting to certain \ninterest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity \nderivatives used for risk management purposes.  \nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be \nhighly effective at reducing the risk associated with the \nexposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to \nbe designated as a hedge, the risk management \nobjective and strategy must be documented. Hedge \ndocumentation must identify the derivative hedging \ninstrument, the asset or liability or forecasted \ntransaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the \neffectiveness of the derivative is assessed \nprospectively and retrospectively. To assess \neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such \nas regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as \ndollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair \nvalue of the derivative to the change in the fair value or \ncash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative \ncomparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any \nchanges in those terms. The extent to which a \nderivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, \nhighly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value \nor cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed \nand documented at least quarterly. If it is determined \nthat a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the \ndesignated exposure, hedge accounting is \ndiscontinued. \nThere are three types of hedge accounting \ndesignations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and \nnet investment hedges. JPMorganChase uses fair \nvalue hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term \ndebt, AFS securities and certain commodities \ninventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the \nchanges in the fair value of the derivative, and in the \nvalue of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are \nrecognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded \nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in \nOCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the \nderivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then \nthe adjustment to the hedged item continues to be \nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, \nfor interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized \nto earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts \naffecting earnings are recognized consistent with the \nclassification of the hedged item – primarily net \ninterest income and principal transactions revenue. \nThe Firm employs the portfolio layer method to \nmanage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate \nassets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis \nadjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and \nare only allocated to individual assets under certain \ncircumstances. These include instances where the \nportfolio amount falls below the hedged layer \namounts, or in cases of voluntary de-designation.\nJPMorganChase uses cash flow hedges primarily to \nhedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash \nflows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and \nforeign currency–denominated revenue and expense. \nFor qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair \nvalue of the derivative are recorded in OCI and \nrecognized in earnings as the hedged item affects \nearnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are \nrecognized consistent with the classification of the \nhedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net \ninterest income and compensation expense. If the \nhedge relationship is terminated, then the change in \nvalue of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized \nin earnings when the cash flows that were hedged \naffect earnings. For hedge relationships that are \ndiscontinued because a forecasted transaction is \nexpected to not occur according to the original hedge \nforecast, any related derivative values recorded in \nAOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. \nJPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to \nprotect the value of the Firm’s net investments in \ncertain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose \nfunctional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For \nqualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair \nvalue of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign \nexchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation \nadjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment \nof effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n210\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features\nIn addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose \nJPMorganChase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations \nunder the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover \nthe payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorganChase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally \nenforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk \ninherent in derivative receivables.\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as \nthe derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair \nvalue of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its \nsubsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, \ngenerally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The \nfollowing table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared \nderivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings \ndowngrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, \n2024 and 2023.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAggregate fair value of net derivative payables\n$ \n15,371 \n$ \n14,655 \nCollateral posted\n \n15,204 \n \n14,673 \nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2024 and \n2023, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that \nmay be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be \nposted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single \nrating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another \nmajor rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional \ninitial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements.

      "text": "Credit derivatives \nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose \nvalue is derived from the credit risk associated with \nthe debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) \nand which allow one party (the protection purchaser) \nto transfer that risk to another party (the protection \nseller). Credit derivatives expose the protection \npurchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection \nseller, as the protection seller is required to make \npayments under the contract when the reference \nentity experiences a credit event, such as a \nbankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a \nrestructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a \npremium for providing protection but has the risk that \nthe underlying instrument referenced in the contract \nwill be subject to a credit event. \nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in \nthe credit derivatives market and uses these \nderivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its \ncapacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively \nmanages a portfolio of credit derivatives by \npurchasing and selling credit protection, \npredominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet \nthe needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the \nFirm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk \nassociated with lending exposures (loans and \nunfunded commitments) in its wholesale and \nconsumer businesses and derivatives counterparty \nexposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage \nthe credit risk arising from certain financial \ninstruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. \nFollowing is a summary of various types of credit \nderivatives. \nCredit default swaps \nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a \nsingle reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based \nindex or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells \nprotection on both single- name and index-reference \nobligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS \ncontracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative \ncontracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the \ndefault risk of a single reference entity, while index \nCDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk \nassociated with the broader credit markets or credit \nmarket segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market \nindices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS \nacross many reference entities. New series of CDS \nindices are periodically established with a new \nunderlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect \nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference \nentities in the index experiences a credit event, then \nthe reference entity that defaulted is removed from the \nindex. CDS can also be referenced against specific \nportfolios of reference names or against customized \nexposure levels: for example, to provide protection \nagainst the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a \n$10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are \ncommonly known as tranche CDS. \nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS \ncontracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under \nthe terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS \ncontract has recourse to the reference entity. The \nprotection purchaser has recourse to the protection \nseller for the difference between the face value of the \nCDS contract and the fair value of the reference \nobligation at settlement of the credit derivative \ncontract, also known as the recovery value. The \nprotection purchaser does not need to hold the debt \ninstrument of the underlying reference entity in order \nto receive amounts due under the CDS contract when \na credit event occurs. \nCredit-related notes \nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a \ncredit risk component where the issuer of the credit-\nrelated note purchases from the note investor credit \nprotection on a reference entity or an index. Under the \ncontract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of \nthe note at the inception of the transaction, and in \nreturn, the issuer makes periodic payments to the \ninvestor, based on the credit risk of the referenced \nentity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value \nof the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or \none of the entities that makes up a reference index) \nexperiences a specified credit event. If a credit event \noccurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par \nvalue of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the \ninvestor the difference between the par value of the \nnote and the fair value of the defaulted reference \nobligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to \nthe credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting \nreference entity.\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional \namounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes \nthe Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2024 \nand 2023. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of \nprotection would typically pay out a percentage of the \nfull notional amount of net protection sold, as the \namount actually required to be paid on the contracts \ntakes into account the recovery value of the reference \nobligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages \nthe credit risk on contracts to sell protection by \npurchasing protection with identical or similar \nunderlying reference entities. Other purchased \nprotection referenced in the following tables includes \ncredit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, \nreference positions (including indices, portfolio \ncoverage and other reference points) as well as \nprotection purchased by CIB through credit-related \nnotes. Other purchased protection also includes credit \nprotection against certain loans in the retained lending \nportfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and \ncredit-related notes. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n222\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

The related contracts are often terminable on \ndemand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to \ndeliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed \nterm, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the \nfuture. Revenue associated with these remaining \nperformance obligations typically depends on the \noccurrence of future events or underlying asset values, \nand is not recognized until the outcome of those \nevents or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees \nThis revenue category includes debt and equity \nunderwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the \nFirm helps clients raise capital via public offering and \nprivate placement of various types of debt and equity \ninstruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on \nthe issuance price and quantity of the underlying \ninstruments, and are recognized as revenue typically \nupon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm \nalso manages and syndicates loan arrangements. \nCredit arrangement and syndication fees, included \nwithin debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue \nafter satisfying certain retention, timing and yield \ncriteria. \nThe Firm also provides advisory services by assisting \nits clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, \nrestructuring and other complex transactions. \nAdvisory fees are recognized as revenue typically \nupon execution of the client’s transaction.\nThe following table presents the components of \ninvestment banking fees. \nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnderwriting\nEquity\n$ 1,687 \n$ \n1,149 \n$ \n975 \nDebt\n \n3,945 \n \n2,610 \n \n2,732 \nTotal underwriting\n \n5,632 \n \n3,759 \n \n3,707 \nAdvisory\n \n3,278 \n \n2,760 \n \n2,979 \nTotal investment banking fees\n$ 8,910 \n$ \n6,519 \n$ 6,686 \nInvestment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB.\nPrincipal transactions \nPrincipal transactions revenue is driven by many \nfactors, including: \n• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between \nthe price at which a market participant is willing and \nable to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at \nwhich another market participant is willing and able \nto buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and \n• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial \ninstruments and commodities transactions, \nincluding those accounted for under the fair value \noption, primarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities. \n– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of \ninstruments, closing out or termination of \ntransactions, or interim cash payments. \n– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in \nvaluation. \nIn connection with its client-driven market-making \nactivities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity \ninstruments, derivatives and commodities, including \nphysical commodities inventories and financial \ninstruments that reference commodities. \nPrincipal transactions revenue also includes realized \nand unrealized gains and losses related to: \n• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge \naccounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges \nof commodity and foreign exchange risk; \n• derivatives used for specific risk management \npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign \nexchange and interest rate risks.\nRefer to Note 5 for further information on the income \nstatement classification of gains and losses from \nderivatives activities. \nIn the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts \nin OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and \nETD that reference a wide range of underlying \ncommodities. In the physical commodity markets, the \nFirm primarily purchases and sells precious and base \nmetals, natural gas, and may hold other commodities \ninventories under financing and other arrangements \nwith clients. \nThe following table presents all realized and unrealized \ngains and losses recorded in principal transactions \nrevenue. This table excludes interest income and \ninterest expense on trading assets and liabilities, \nwhich are an integral part of the overall performance of \nthe Firm’s client-driven market-making activities in \nCIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and \nCIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest \nincome and interest expense.  \nTrading revenue is presented primarily by instrument \ntype.

Substantially all the \ndefined benefit pension plans are closed to new \nparticipants. The principal defined benefit pension plan \nin the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. \nemployees, was closed to new participants and frozen \nfor existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and \nJanuary 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, \n2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to \nparticipants’ accounts based on their accumulated \nbalances.\nThe Firm maintains funded and unfunded \npostretirement benefit plans that provide medical and \nlife insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees \nas well as their dependents covered under these \nprograms. None of these plans have a material impact \non the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution \nplan in the U.S. and maintains other similar \narrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most \nsignificant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) \nSavings Plan (“the 401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers \nsubstantially all U.S. employees. Employees can \ncontribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or \nRoth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual \nmatching and pay credit contributions to the 401(k) \nSavings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.  \nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts \nrecorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB \nplans. \nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n (in millions) \n2024\n2023\nProjected benefit obligations\n$ \n(14,459) \n$ \n(14,740) \nFair value of plan assets\n \n22,201 \n \n22,013 \nNet funded status\n \n7,742 \n \n7,273 \nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)\n \n(1,649) \n \n(1,517) \nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was \n5.49% and 5.16%, respectively.\nGains and losses\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit \nobligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded \nin OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are \nrecognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over \nsubsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, \nthe net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the \nprojected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan \nassets. Amortization is generally over the average \nexpected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given \nthe frozen status of most plans. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024, the net loss was attributable to \nlower than expected returns on plan assets, partially \noffset by projected benefit obligation net gains \nprimarily related to changes in the discount rate.

      "text": "Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives\nEmployee share-based awards\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, JPMorganChase granted \nlong-term share-based awards to certain employees \nunder its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May \n18, 2021, and subsequently amended effective May 21, \n2024. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, \n2024, 81 million shares of common stock were \navailable for issuance through May 2028. The LTIP is \nthe only active plan under which the Firm is currently \ngranting share-based incentive awards. In the \nfollowing discussion, the LTIP constitutes the Firm’s \nshare-based incentive plans. \nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon \ntheir grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and \nvest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after \nthree years and are converted into shares of common \nstock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically \ninclude full-career eligibility provisions, which allow \nemployees to continue to vest upon voluntary \ntermination based on age and/or service-related \nrequirements, subject to post-employment and other \nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture \nuntil vested and contain clawback provisions that may \nresult in cancellation under certain specified \ncircumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the \nrecipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any \ndividends paid on the underlying common stock \nduring the period the RSUs are outstanding. \nPerformance share units (“PSUs”) are granted \nannually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of \nDirectors, to members of the Firm’s Operating \nCommittee under the variable compensation program. \nPSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of \nspecified performance criteria over a three-year \nperiod. The number of awards that vest can range from \nzero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, \ndividends that accrue during the vesting period are \nreinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs \nand the related dividend equivalent share units are \nconverted into shares of common stock after vesting.\nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units \nhave vested, the shares of common stock that are \ndelivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be \nretained for an additional holding period, for a total \ncombined vesting and holding period of approximately \nfive to eight years from the grant date depending on \nregulations in certain countries. \nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”)  \nwere granted with an exercise price equal to the fair \nvalue of JPMorganChase’s common stock on the grant \ndate. SARs expire ten years after the grant date. There \nwere no grants of SARs in 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation \nexpense for each tranche of each award, net of \nestimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award \nwith its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche \ngranted, compensation expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting \ndate of the respective tranche, provided that the \nemployees will not become full-career eligible during \nthe vesting period. For awards with full-career \neligibility provisions and awards granted with no future \nsubstantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the \nestimated value of awards expected to be awarded to \nemployees as of the grant date without giving \nconsideration to the impact of post-employment \nrestrictions. For each tranche granted to employees \nwho will become full-career eligible during the vesting \nperiod, compensation expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier \nof the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the \nvesting date of the respective tranche. \nThe Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of \nemployee share-based incentive awards is to issue \neither new shares of common stock or treasury shares. \nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Firm settled all of its \nemployee share-based awards by issuing treasury \nshares. \nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the \nclassification of share-based awards for purposes of \ncalculating earnings per share.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n233",

      "text": "AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value \nis less than the amortized cost. \nThe Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if \nthe Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it \nis more likely than not that the Firm will be required to \nsell the debt security before recovery of its amortized \ncost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is \nrecognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in \nthe Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to \nthe full difference between the amortized cost (net of \nallowance if applicable) and the fair value of the \nsecurity. \nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the \nintent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated \nto determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined \nthat a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an \nallowance for credit losses through the provision for \ncredit losses in the Consolidated Statements of \nIncome, limited by the amount of impairment. Any \nimpairment on debt securities that the Firm has the \nintent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is \nrecorded in OCI. \nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include \nadverse conditions specifically related to the industry, \ngeographic area or financial condition of the issuer or \nunderlying collateral of a security; and payment \nstructure of the security. \nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization \nfor credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows \nconsidering relevant market and economic data, \nunderlying loan-level data, and structural features of \nthe securitization, such as subordination, excess \nspread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit \nenhancement, and compares the losses projected for \nthe underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the \nlevel of credit enhancement in the securitization \nstructure to determine whether these features are \nsufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit \nloss exists. \nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated \nbelow “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be \ncontractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a \nway that the Firm would not recover substantially all of \nits recorded investment, the Firm evaluates \nimpairment for credit losses when there is an adverse \nchange in expected cash flows. \nHTM securities – credit risk\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities \nrepresents expected credit losses over the remaining \nexpected life of the securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of \nU.S. states and municipalities and commercial \nmortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying \nstatistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) \nto the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are \nderived using a weighted average of five internally \ndeveloped eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, \nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation to \nrevert to long run historical information for periods \nbeyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further \ninformation on the eight-quarter macroeconomic \nforecast. \nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized \nloan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed \nsecurities is calculated as the difference between the \namortized cost and the present value of the cash flows \nexpected to be collected, discounted at the security’s \neffective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are \ndeveloped based on expectations of underlying \ncollateral performance derived using the eight-quarter \nmacroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as considering the structural \nfeatures of the security. \nThe application of different inputs and assumptions \ninto the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is \nsubject to significant management judgment, and \nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or \nconsidering other inputs or assumptions, could affect \nthe estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM \nsecurities. \nCredit quality indicator\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities \nis the risk rating assigned to each security. At both \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, all HTM securities were \nrated investment grade and were current and \naccruing, with approximately 99% rated at least AA+ \n(based upon external ratings where available, and \nwhere not available, based primarily upon internal risk \nratings).\nAllowance for credit losses on investment securities\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment \nsecurities was $152 million, $128 million and \n$96 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, \nrespectively, which included a cumulative-effect \nadjustment to retained earnings related to the transfer \nof HTM securities to AFS for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023.\nSelected impacts of investment securities on the \nConsolidated statements of income\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRealized gains\n$ 593 \n$ \n622 \n$ \n198 \nRealized losses\n (1,614)  (3,802)  (2,578) \nInvestment securities losses\n$ (1,021) $ (3,180) $ (2,380)\nProvision for credit losses\n$ \n24 \n$ \n38 \n$ \n54 \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n238\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of \nrelated hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield \nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected \nmaturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call \ndate.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $49 million and the \nportfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $(1.2) billion at December 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also \nexcludes the allowance for credit losses of $103 million at December 31, 2024.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual \nmaturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential \nMBS, six years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage \nobligations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n239",

      "text": "Note 11 – Securities financing activities\nJPMorganChase enters into resale, repurchase, \nsecurities borrowed and securities loaned agreements \n(collectively, “securities financing agreements”) \nprimarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, \nacquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate \ncustomers’ financing needs, settle other securities \nobligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash.  \nSecurities financing agreements are treated as \ncollateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated \nbalance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable \naccounting guidance, securities financing agreements \nwith the same counterparty are reported on a net \nbasis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the \noffsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and \npaid in connection with securities financing \nagreements are recorded over the life of the \nagreement in interest income and interest expense on \nthe Consolidated statements of income. \nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain \nsecurities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for \nfurther information regarding the fair value option. The \nsecurities financing agreements for which the fair \nvalue option has been elected are reported within \nsecurities purchased under resale agreements, \nsecurities loaned or sold under repurchase \nagreements, and securities borrowed on the \nConsolidated balance sheets. Generally, for \nagreements carried at fair value, current-period \ninterest accruals are recorded within interest income \nand interest expense, with changes in fair value \nreported in principal transactions revenue. However, \nfor financial instruments containing embedded \nderivatives that would be separately accounted for in \naccordance with accounting guidance for hybrid \ninstruments, all changes in fair value, including any \ninterest elements, are reported in principal \ntransactions revenue. \nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the \nfair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a \nresult of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices \ndescribed below, the Firm did not hold any allowance \nfor credit losses with respect to resale and securities \nborrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and \n2023.\nCredit risk mitigation practices\nSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm \nprimarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these \nrisks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying \nsecurities (predominantly high-quality securities \ncollateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. \nGSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has \nreceived from or provided to its counterparties \ncompared to the value of cash proceeds and \nexchanged collateral, and either requests additional \ncollateral or returns securities or collateral when \nappropriate. Margin levels are initially established \nbased upon the counterparty, the type of underlying \nsecurities, and the permissible collateral, and are \nmonitored on an ongoing basis. \nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the \nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the \nvalue of the securities received is less than initial cash \nprincipal advanced and any collateral amounts \nexchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned \nagreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent \nthat the value of underlying securities advanced \nexceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, \nand any collateral amounts exchanged. \nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master \nnetting agreements and other similar arrangements \nwith its counterparties, which provide for the right to \nliquidate the underlying securities and any collateral \namounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty \ndefault. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, \nwhere possible, of the securities underlying resale and \nsecurities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for \nfurther information regarding assets pledged and \ncollateral received in securities financing agreements.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n240\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "Note 12 – Loans\nLoan accounting framework\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management’s \nstrategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans \nbased on the following categories:\n• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment \n(i.e., “retained”)\n• Loans held-for-sale\n• Loans at fair value\nThe following provides a detailed accounting \ndiscussion of the Firm’s loans by category:\nLoans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, \nincluding PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, \nreflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the \nfollowing: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, \npremiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; \nand foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include \nbilled finance charges and fees.\nInterest income\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-\ninvestment is accrued and recognized as interest \nincome at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase \nprice discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred \nloan fees or costs, are recognized in interest income \nover the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of \nyield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including \naccrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in \naccrued interest and accounts receivables on the \nConsolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, \naccrued interest once billed is then recognized in the \nloan balances, with the related allowance recorded in \nthe allowance for credit losses. Changes in the \nallowance for credit losses on accrued interest on \ncredit card loans are recognized in the provision for \ncredit losses and charge-offs are recognized by \nreversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm \ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit \nlosses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with \nits policy to write them off no later than 90 days past \ndue by reversing interest income. \nNonaccrual loans \nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of \ninterest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit \ncard loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. \ngovernment agencies) are placed on nonaccrual \nstatus and considered nonperforming when full \npayment of principal and interest is not expected, \nregardless of delinquency status, or when principal \nand interest has been in default for a period of 90 days \nor more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the \nprocess of collection. A loan is determined to be past \ndue when the minimum payment is not received from \nthe borrower by the contractually specified due date or \nfor certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), \nwhen a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 \ndays or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are \ntypically maintained on nonaccrual status. \nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all \ninterest accrued but not collected is reversed against \ninterest income. In addition, the amortization of \ndeferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on \nnonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest \npayments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the \nrecorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; \nhowever, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate \ncollectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest \ncash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value \nof the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer \nloans, application of this policy typically results in the \nFirm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual \nconsumer loans on a cash basis.\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when \nrepayment is reasonably assured and there has been \ndemonstrated performance under the terms of the \nloan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured \nloan. \nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans \nare generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual \nstatus; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit \ncard loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged \noff or paid in full. \nAllowance for loan losses \nThe allowance for loan losses represents the \nestimated expected credit losses in the held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date \nand is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra \nasset, which brings the amortized cost to the net \ncarrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan \nlosses resulting from lending-related activity, \nmacroeconomic variables, changes in credit and other \ninputs are recorded in the provision for credit losses \non the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. \nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s \naccounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. \nCharge-offs \nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged \ndown to the lower of the amortized cost or the net \nrealizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair \nvalue less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the \nallowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified \nstages of delinquency in accordance with standards \nestablished by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, \nunmodified credit card loans and scored business \nbanking loans are generally charged off no later than \n180 days past due.

The \ndetermination of whether to recognize a charge-off \nincludes many factors, including the prioritization of \nthe Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the \nworkout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the \nborrower’s equity or the loan collateral. \nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its \namortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of \nthe underlying collateral, the determination of the fair \nvalue of the collateral depends on the type of collateral \n(e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the \ncollateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair \nvalue is based on quoted market prices or broker \nquotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, \nthe fair value of the collateral is generally estimated \nusing a discounted cash flow model. \nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are \nbased upon external valuation sources. When it \nbecomes likely that a borrower is either unable or \nunwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price \nopinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation \nmodel of the home based on an exterior-only valuation \n(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least \nevery 12 months, or more frequently depending on \nvarious market factors. As soon as practicable after \nthe Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt \n(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the \nFirm generally obtains an appraisal based on an \ninspection that includes the interior of the home \n(“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior \nappraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s \nexperience with actual liquidation values as compared \nwith the estimated values provided by exterior \nopinions and interior appraisals, considering state-\nspecific factors. \nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are \ngenerally based on appraisals from internal and \nexternal valuation sources. Collateral values are \ntypically updated every six to twelve months, either by \nobtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal \nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The \nFirm also considers both borrower- and market-\nspecific factors, which may result in obtaining \nappraisal updates or broker price opinions at more \nfrequent intervals.\nLoans held-for-sale \nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost \nor fair value, with valuation changes recorded in \nnoninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the \nvaluation is performed on a portfolio basis. For \nwholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an \nindividual loan basis. \nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and \nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. \nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price \ndiscounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan \naccount until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees \nor costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment \nto the basis of the loan and therefore are included in \nthe periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair \nvalue adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized \nat the time of sale. \nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of \ncost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses \nand charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. \nHowever, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s \nnonaccrual policies. \nLoans at fair value \nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected \nare measured at fair value, with changes in fair value \nrecorded in noninterest revenue. \nInterest income on these loans is accrued and \nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. \nChanges in fair value are recognized in noninterest \nrevenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront \nin noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are \nrecognized in the associated expense category as \nincurred. \nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the \nFirm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off \npolicies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at \nfair value are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. \nRefer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s \nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value \noption. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further \ninformation on loans carried at fair value and classified \nas trading assets. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n244\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "Loan classification changes \nLoans in the held-for-investment portfolio that \nmanagement decides to sell are transferred to the \nheld-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value \non the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are \ncharged against the allowance for loan losses; non-\ncredit related losses such as those due to changes in \ninterest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are \nrecognized in noninterest revenue. \nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan \nin the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to \nthe held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on \nthe date of transfer. These loans are subsequently \nassessed for impairment based on the Firm’s \nallowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further \ndiscussion of the methodologies used in establishing \nthe Firm’s allowance for loan losses. \nLoan modifications \nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction \nwith its loss mitigation activities. Through the \nmodification, JPMorganChase grants one or more \nconcessions to a borrower who is experiencing \nfinancial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s \neconomic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession \nof the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments \nreceived by the Firm from the borrower. The \nconcessions granted vary by program and by \nborrower-specific characteristics, and may include \ninterest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. \nLoans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs \nare generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in \nmany cases such loans were already on nonaccrual \nstatus prior to modification. These loans may be \nreturned to performing status (the accrual of interest is \nresumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the \nborrower has performed under the modified terms for \na minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) \nthe Firm has an expectation that repayment of the \nmodified loan is reasonably assured based on, for \nexample, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of \nfuture earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other \ncurrent market considerations. In certain limited and \nwell-defined circumstances in which the loan is current \nat the modification date, such loans are not placed on \nnonaccrual status at the time of modification. \nThe allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs \nis measured using the Firm’s established allowance \nmethodology, which considers the expected default \nrates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for \nfurther discussion. \nForeclosed property \nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through \nloan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. \nProperty acquired may include real property (e.g., \nresidential real estate, land, and buildings) and other \ncommercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, \naircraft, railcars, and ships). \nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon \nreceiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking \nlegal title or physical possession). For loans \ncollateralized by real property, the Firm generally \nrecognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or \nupon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure \ntransaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are \nreported in other assets on the Consolidated balance \nsheets and initially recognized at fair value less \nestimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of \nthe acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if \nnecessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. \nSubsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/\ncredited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, \nsuch as real estate taxes and maintenance, are \ncharged to other expense. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n245",

      "text": "Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio\nConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist \nprimarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity \nloans and lines of credit, auto and business banking \nloans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer \ncredit market. These loans include home equity loans \nsecured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an \ninterest-only payment period, and certain payment-\noption loans that may result in negative amortization. \nThe following table provides information about \nretained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by \nclass. \nDecember 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nResidential real estate\n$ \n309,513 $ \n326,409 \nAuto and other\n \n66,821  \n70,866 \nTotal retained loans\n$ \n376,334 $ \n397,275 \nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality \nindicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than \n30 days past due provide an early warning of \nborrowers who may be experiencing financial \ndifficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to \nrepay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it \nbecomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to \nbe unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential \nreal estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater \nthan 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans \nthat will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar \nliquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency \nrates, other credit quality indicators for consumer \nloans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: \n• For residential real estate loans, the current \nestimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in \nthe case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the \npotential loss severity in the event of default. \nAdditionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can \nprovide insight into a borrower’s continued \nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-\nLTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans \nwhere the borrower has equity in the collateral. The \ngeographic distribution of the loan collateral also \nprovides insight as to the credit quality of the \nportfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, \nhome price changes and specific events such as \nnatural disasters, will affect credit quality. The \nborrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a \nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, \nas FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s \ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower \nwith a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered \nto be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a \nhigher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with \na high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater \nrisk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both \na high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\n• For scored auto and business banking loans, \ngeographic distribution is an indicator of the credit \nperformance of the portfolio. Similar to residential \nreal estate loans, geographic distribution provides \ninsights into the portfolio performance based on \nregional economic activity and events.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n248\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "Credit card loan portfolio\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card \nloans originated and purchased by the Firm. \nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality \nindicator for credit card loans as they provide an early \nwarning that borrowers may be experiencing \ndifficulties (30 days past due); information on those \nborrowers that have been delinquent for a longer \nperiod of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In \naddition to delinquency rates, the geographic \ndistribution of the loans provides insight as to the \ncredit quality of the portfolio based on the regional \neconomy.\nWhile the borrower’s credit score is another general \nindicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view \ncredit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality \nbecause the borrower’s credit score tends to be a \nlagging indicator. The distribution of such scores \nprovides a general indicator of credit quality trends \nwithin the portfolio; however, the score does not \ncapture all factors that would be predictive of future \ncredit performance.

      "text": "Wholesale loan portfolio\nWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of \nclients, ranging from large corporate and institutional \nclients to small businesses and high-net-worth \nindividuals.\nThe primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans \nis the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk \nratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans \nand differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings \non loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the \nlikelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the \nestimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon \nthe default of the borrower and takes into \nconsideration collateral and structural support for \neach credit facility. \nManagement considers several factors to determine \nan appropriate internal risk rating, including the \nobligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the \nlevel of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources \nfor repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, \nmanagement strength, and the industry and \ngeography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s \ninternal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative \ncharacteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet \nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in \nthe economic environment) defined by S&P and \nMoody’s, however the quantitative characteristics \n(e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal \nhistorical experiences and assumptions. The Firm \ngenerally considers internal ratings with qualitative \ncharacteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as \ninvestment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD \nand/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.  \nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as \nnoncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion \nis further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual \nloans, representing management’s assessment of the \ncollectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans \nhave a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s \ndefinition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking \nregulatory definition of criticized exposures, which \nconsist of special mention, substandard and doubtful \ncategories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.   \nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing \nbasis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as \nnecessary for updated information affecting the \nobligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the \nindustry in which the obligor conducts its operations. \nAs part of the overall credit risk management \nframework, the Firm focuses on the management and \ndiversification of its industry and client exposures, with \nparticular attention paid to industries with an actual or \npotential credit concern.

      "text": "Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents \nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses over \nthe remaining expected life of the Firm's financial \nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The \nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s \nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), \n• the allowance for lending-related commitments, \nwhich is presented on the Consolidated balance \nsheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and \n• the allowance for credit losses on investment \nsecurities, which is reflected in investment securities \non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the \nallowance for credit losses is recognized in the \nprovision for credit losses. \nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for \ncredit losses is complex and requires significant \njudgment by management about the effect of matters \nthat are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the \nallowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the \nCFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent \nevaluations of credit exposures, considering the \nmacroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors \nthen prevailing, may result in significant changes in the \nallowance for credit losses in future periods. \nThe Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for \nloan losses and its allowance for lending-related \ncommitments are described in the following \nparagraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the \npolicies used to determine the allowance for credit \nlosses on investment securities. \nMethodology for allowances for loan losses and \nlending-related commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for \nlending-related commitments represents expected \ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of \nretained loans and lending-related commitments that \nare not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not \nrecord an allowance for future draws on unconditionally \ncancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit \ncards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on \ncredit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance \nfor loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an \nallowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to \nits policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 \ndays past due by reversing interest income. \nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by \nconsidering its contractual term, expected \nprepayments, cancellation features, and certain \nextension and call options. The expected life of funded \ncredit card loans is generally estimated by considering \nexpected future payments on the credit card account, \nand determining how much of those amounts should be \nallocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as \nof the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. \nThis allocation is made using an approach that \nincorporates the payment application requirements of \nthe Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and \nDisclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the \nhighest interest rate balances first. \nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes \nexpected recoveries of amounts previously charged off \nor expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries \nresult in a negative allowance. \nCollective and Individual Assessments\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the \nallowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm \nassesses whether exposures share similar risk \ncharacteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the \nFirm estimates expected credit losses collectively, \nconsidering the risk associated with a particular pool \nand the probability that the exposures within the pool \nwill deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk \ncharacteristics is subject to significant management \njudgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another \nor considering additional characteristics could affect \nthe allowance. \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer \nportfolio include product type, delinquency status, \ncurrent FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for \ncollateralized loans, current LTV ratios.  \n• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale \nportfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, \ntenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, \nindustry, credit enhancement, product type, facility \npurpose, and payment terms. \nThe majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk \ncharacteristics with other similar exposures, and as a \nresult are collectively assessed for impairment \n(“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based \ncomponent covers consumer loans, performing risk-\nrated loans and certain lending-related commitments. \nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with \nother exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected \ncredit losses on an individual basis, considering \nexpected repayment and conditions impacting that \nindividual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The \nasset-specific component covers collateral-dependent \nloans and risk-rated loans that have been placed on \nnonaccrual status. \nPortfolio-based component\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a \nquantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of \nthe borrower changing delinquency status or moving \nfrom one risk rating to another. The quantitative \ncalculation covers expected credit losses over an \ninstrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying \ncredit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at \ndefault. The credit loss factors incorporate the \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n266\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in \nthe event of default. They are derived using a weighted \naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic \nscenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, \nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation to \nrevert to long run historical information for periods \nbeyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five \nmacroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative \nadverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme \nupside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central \nforecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration \nthe Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal \nperspectives from subject matter experts across the \nFirm, and market consensus and involve a governed \nprocess that incorporates feedback from senior \nmanagement across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk \nManagement.\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into \nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk \nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that \nare not yet reflected in the calculation. These \nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the \nhistorical loss experience, including during stressed \nperiods, for each major product or model. Management \napplies judgment in making this adjustment, including \ntaking into account uncertainties associated with the \neconomic and political conditions, quality of \nunderwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit \nconcentrations or deterioration within an industry, \nproduct or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal \nand external factors affecting the credit quality of the \nportfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships \nbetween these factors create further uncertainties.\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative \ncalculation, and the assumptions used by management \nto adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to \nsignificant management judgment, and emphasizing \none input or assumption over another, or considering \nother inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate \nof the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for \nlending-related commitments.\nAsset-specific component \nTo determine the asset-specific component of the \nallowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those \nloans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual \nrisk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are \ngenerally evaluated individually.\nFor collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of \ncollateral less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is \nused to determine the charge-off amount for declines in \nvalue (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the \nfair value of collateral) or the amount of negative \nallowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of \nprior charge-offs associated with improvements in the \nfair value of the collateral).\nFor non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally \nmeasures the asset-specific allowance as the \ndifference between the amortized cost of the loan and \nthe present value of the cash flows expected to be \ncollected, discounted at the loan’s effective interest \nrate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally \nrecognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan \nlosses. The asset-specific component of the allowance \nfor non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the \neffect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash \nflows including changes in interest rates, principal \nforgiveness, and other concessions, as well as  \nmanagement’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to \nrepay under the modified terms. \nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows \nis highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely \nupon estimates such as loss severities, asset \nvaluations, the amounts and timing of interest or \nprincipal payments (including any expected \nprepayments) or other factors that are reflective of \ncurrent and expected market conditions. These \nestimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the \nduration of current overall economic conditions, \nindustry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the \nexpected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well \nas, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All \nof these estimates and assumptions require significant \nmanagement judgment and certain assumptions are \nhighly subjective. \nOther financial assets\nIn addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm \nholds other financial assets that are measured at \namortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, \nincluding credit exposures arising from lending \nactivities subject to collateral maintenance \nrequirements. Management estimates the allowance \nfor other financial assets using various techniques \nconsidering historical losses and current economic \nconditions. \nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to \ncollateral maintenance requirements is generally \nmitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of \nthe activity, the fair value of collateral held and the \nFirm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to \nprovide additional margin when the fair value of the \ncollateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, \nthese exposures generally do not require an allowance \nfor credit losses. However, management may also \nconsider other factors such as the borrower’s ongoing \nability to provide collateral to satisfy margin \nrequirements, or whether collateral is significantly \nconcentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with \nsimilar risk characteristics. If in management’s \njudgment, an allowance for credit losses for these \nexposures is required, the Firm estimates expected \ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral and \nprobability of borrower default.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n267",

The Firm \nconsiders a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorganChase is the primary beneficiary of the \nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorganChase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments \nwith the JPMorganChase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorganChase–administered asset-backed commercial paper \nconduit.\nLine of \nBusiness\nTransaction Type\nActivity\n2024 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCB\nCredit card securitization trusts\nSecuritization of originated credit card \nreceivables\npages 271–272\nMortgage securitization trusts\nServicing and securitization of both originated \nand purchased residential mortgages\npages 272–274\nCIB\nMortgage and other securitization trusts\nSecuritization of both originated and purchased \nresidential and commercial mortgages, and \nother consumer loans\npages 272–274\nMulti-seller conduits\nAssisting clients in accessing the financial \nmarkets in a cost-efficient manner and \nstructuring transactions to meet investor needs\npage 274\nMunicipal bond vehicles\nFinancing of municipal bond investments\npages 274–275\nThe Firm’s other business segments and Corporate are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-\nsponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows: \n• Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset \nmanager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment \nobjective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, \nconsidered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\n• Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are \ngenerally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of \ninvestments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties \nwhich may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have \nthe power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. \nRefer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs \nsponsored by third parties. Refer to page 276 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third \nparties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs\nCredit card securitizations\nCCB’s Card Services business may securitize \noriginated credit card loans, primarily through the \nChase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s \ncontinuing involvement in credit card securitizations \nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an \nundivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining \ncertain senior and subordinated securities and \nmaintaining escrow accounts. \nThe Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its \nsponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be \nthe primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts \nbased on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of \nthese VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and \nother duties, including making decisions as to the \nreceivables that are transferred into those trusts and \nas to any related modifications and workouts. \nAdditionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other \ncontinuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated \nabove, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives \nthe Firm the right to receive certain benefits from \nthese VIEs that could potentially be significant. \nThe underlying securitized credit card receivables and \nother assets of the securitization trusts are available \nonly for payment of the beneficial interests issued by \nthe securitization trusts; they are not available to pay \nthe Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s \ncreditors. \nThe agreements with the credit card securitization \ntrusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum \nundivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally \n5%). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm held \nundivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card \nsecuritization trusts of $6.6 billion and $4.9 billion, \nrespectively.

      "text": "Residential mortgage\nThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans \noriginated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage \nloans purchased from third parties by either CCB or \nCIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential \nmortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for \ncertain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For \nsecuritizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has \nthe power to direct the significant activities of the VIE \nbecause it is responsible for decisions related to loan \nmodifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an \ninterest upon securitization.\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading \nactivities involving securities issued by Firm-\nsponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at \ntimes retains senior and/or subordinated interests \n(including residual interests and amounts required to \nbe held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in \nresidential mortgage securitizations at the time of \nsecuritization, and/or reacquires positions in the \nsecondary market in the normal course of business. In \ncertain instances, as a result of the positions retained \nor reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or \nCCB, when considered together with the servicing \narrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is \ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain \nsecuritization trusts. \nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage \nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-\nsponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore \ndoes not have the power to direct the most significant \nactivities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial \ninterest in the trust that could potentially be significant \nto the trust.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer \nsecuritizations\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage \nloans, and engages in underwriting and trading \nactivities involving the securities issued by \nsecuritization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/\nor subordinated interests (including amounts required \nto be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in \ncommercial mortgage securitizations at the time of \nsecuritization but, generally, the Firm does not service \ncommercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO \nmay choose to invest in these securitizations as well. \nFor commercial mortgage securitizations the power to \ndirect the significant activities of the VIE generally is \nheld by the servicer or investors in a specified class of \nsecurities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally \ndoes not retain an interest in the controlling class in its \nsponsored commercial mortgage securitization \ntransactions.\nRe-securitizations\nThe Firm engages in certain re-securitization \ntransactions in which debt securities are transferred to \na VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These \ntransfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and \ngovernment agency sponsored VIEs, which are \nbacked by residential mortgages. The Firm’s \nconsolidation analysis is largely dependent on the \nFirm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of \nsecurities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government \nagencies\n$ 44,456 \n$ 18,864 \n$ 16,128 \nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved \nare client-driven transactions in which a specific client \nor group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk \nprofile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded \nthat the decision-making power of the entity is shared \nbetween the Firm and its clients, considering the joint \neffort and decisions in establishing the re-\nsecuritization trust and its assets, as well as the \nsignificant economic interest the client holds in the re-\nsecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not \nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nThe Firm did not transfer any private label securities to \nre-securitization VIEs during 2024, 2023 and 2022, \nand retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored \nVIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not \nmaterial.\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests \nof third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and \ngenerally purchases these interests in the secondary \nmarket. In these circumstances, the Firm does not \nhave the unilateral ability to direct the most significant \nactivities of the re-securitization trust, either because \nit was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or \nthe Firm was involved with an independent third-party \nsponsor and demonstrated shared power over the \ncreation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not \nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n273",

In most \ninstances, the assets are structured with deal-specific \ncredit enhancements provided to the conduits by the \ncustomers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-\nspecific credit enhancements are generally structured \nto cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the \npool of assets, and are typically in the form of \novercollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-\nspecific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s \npotential losses on its agreements with the conduits.\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, \nand to provide the conduits with funding to provide \nfinancing to customers in the event that the conduits \ndo not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, \neach asset pool financed by the conduits has a \nminimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility \nassociated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, \nN.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the \nmulti-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted \nprogram-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide \ncredit enhancement in the form of standby letters of \ncredit. The amount of program-wide credit \nenhancement required is based upon commercial \npaper issuance and approximates 10% of the \noutstanding balance of commercial paper.\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-\nseller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to \ndirect the significant activities of the conduits and a \npotentially significant economic interest in the \nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in \nstructuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions \nregarding asset types and credit quality, and manages \nthe commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. \nThe Firm’s interests that could potentially be \nsignificant to the VIEs include the fees received as \nadministrative agent and liquidity and program-wide \ncredit enhancement provider, as well as the potential \nexposure created by the liquidity and credit \nenhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorganChase \nmakes markets in and invests in commercial paper \nissued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. \nThe Firm held $2.9 billion and $9.8 billion of the \ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered \nmulti-seller conduits at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, which have been eliminated in \nconsolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the \nFirm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven \nby market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required \nto be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the \nFirm is not obligated under any agreement to \npurchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity \nand credit enhancement provided by the Firm have \nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-\nrelated commitments to certain clients of the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded \ncommitments were $10.3 billion and $10.8 billion at \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are \nreported as off-balance sheet lending-related \ncommitments in other unfunded commitments to \nextend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information \non off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. \nMunicipal bond vehicles\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) \ntrusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond \ninvestments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB \ntransaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal \nbond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by \nissuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-\nrate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-\nrate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are \ntypically purchased by money market funds or other \nshort-term investors and may be tendered, with \nrequisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are \nretained by the investor seeking to finance its \nmunicipal bond investment. TOB transactions where \nthe residual is held by a third-party investor are \ntypically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are transactions where the \nResidual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts \nare sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as \nsponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The \nFirm may provide various services to a TOB trust, \nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option \nprovider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing \nagent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing \nagent is responsible for establishing the periodic \nvariable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n274\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nNonconsolidated \nre-securitization VIEs 2024",

Morgan Securities \nLLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option \nprovider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s \nobligation to perform is conditional and is limited by \ncertain events (“Termination Events”), which include \nbankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond \nissuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of \ntaxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate \ndowngrade of the municipal bond to below investment \ngrade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is \ntypically further limited by the high credit quality of the \nunderlying municipal bonds, the excess \ncollateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain \ntransactions, the reimbursement agreements with the \nResidual holders.\nHolders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their \nfloaters to the TOB trust.

These include, for example, acting as \na derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, \nunderwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, \ntrustee or custodian. These transactions are \nconducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit \ndecisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, \ntaking into consideration the quality of the underlying \nassets. Where the Firm does not have the power to \ndirect the activities of the VIE that most significantly \nimpact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable \ninterest that could potentially be significant, the Firm \ngenerally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records \nand reports these positions on its Consolidated \nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record \nand report positions in respect of any other third-party \ntransaction. \nTax credit vehicles \nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax \ncredit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and \nsimilar entities that own and operate affordable \nhousing, alternative energy, and other projects. These \nentities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is \ntypically the general partner or managing member and \nhas control over the significant activities of the tax \ncredit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not \nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally \ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and \nearns a return primarily through the receipt of tax \ncredits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss \nexposure, represented by equity investments and \nfunding commitments, was $35.2 billion and $35.1 \nbillion, of which $15.0 billion and $14.7 billion was \nunfunded at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively.

Refer to Note 28 for more information on \noff-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to \nthe Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit \nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization \nMethod guidance which expanded the types of tax-\noriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax \ncredit investments, that the Firm can elect on a \nprogram by program basis, to be accounted for using \nthe proportional amortization method. Refer to Notes \n1, 6 and 25 for further information.\nThe proportional amortization method requires the \ncost of eligible investments, within an elected \nprogram, be amortized in proportion to the tax \nbenefits received with the resulting amortization \nreported directly in income tax expense, which aligns \nwith the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. \nInvestments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, \nincluding that substantially all of the return is from \nincome tax credits and other income tax benefits.\nIn addition, under this method deferred taxes are \ngenerally not recorded as the investment is now \namortized in proportion to the income tax credits and \nother income tax benefits received. Delayed equity \ncontributions that are unconditional and legally \nbinding or conditional and probable of occurring are \nrecorded in other liabilities with a corresponding \nincrease in the carrying value of the investment. The \nguidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible \ninvestments when significant modifications or events \noccur that result in a change in the nature of the \ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship with \nthe underlying project. During the period, there were \nno significant modifications or events that resulted in a \nchange in the nature of an eligible investment or a \nchange in the Firm's relationship with the underlying \nproject.\nThe following table provides information on tax-\noriented investments for which the Firm elected to \napply the proportional amortization method. \nYear ended December 31,\n (in millions) \nAlternative energy and \naffordable housing programs\n(d)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPrograms for which the Firm \nelected proportional \namortization:\nCarrying value\n(a)\n$ 31,978 $ 14,644 $ 12,052 \nTax credits and other tax \nbenefits\n(b)\n \n6,379  \n2,044  \n1,786 \nInvestments that qualify to be \naccounted for using \nproportional amortization:\nAmortization losses recognized \nas a component of income tax \nexpense\n \n(5,018)  \n(1,561)  \n(1,353) \nNon-income-tax-related gains/\n(losses) and other returns \nreceived that are recognized \noutside of income tax expense\n(c)  \n142  \n(1)  \n(1) \n(a) Recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nExcludes programs to which the Firm does not apply the \nproportional amortization method, such as historic tax credit and \nnew market tax credit programs.\n(b) Reflected in Income tax expense on the Consolidated \nstatements of income and Operating activities on the \nConsolidated statements of cash flows.\n(c) Recorded in Other income on the Consolidated statements of \nincome and Operating activities on the Consolidated statements \nof cash flows.\n(d) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 represents eligible affordable \nhousing investments.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n276\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\nAlternative energy and \naffordable housing programs\n(d)\nAlternative energy and \naffordable housing programs\n(d)",

In certain customer TOB \ntransactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has \nentered into a reimbursement agreement with the \nResidual holder. In those transactions, upon the \ntermination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the \nthird-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm \ndoes not have any intent to protect Residual holders \nfrom potential losses on any of the underlying \nmunicipal bonds.

If the fair value is in excess \nof the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill \nis considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less \nthan the carrying value, then an impairment is \nrecognized for the amount by which the reporting \nunit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the \namount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nThe Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital \nplus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for \nthe carrying values of equity for the reporting units in \nthe goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity \nis determined on a similar basis as the allocation of \ncapital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a \nvariety of factors including capital levels of similarly \nrated peers and applicable regulatory capital \nrequirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are \nincorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, \nwhich is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and \nOperating Committee. \nThe primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair \nvalue of its reporting units is the income approach. \nThis approach projects cash flows for the forecast \nperiod and uses the perpetuity growth method to \ncalculate terminal values. These cash flows and \nterminal values, which are based on the reporting \nunits’ annual budgets and forecasts are then \ndiscounted using an appropriate discount rate. The \ndiscount rate used for each reporting unit represents \nan estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit \nand is determined considering the Firm’s overall \nestimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital \nAsset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk \ncharacteristics specific to each reporting unit (for \nexample, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty \nassociated with the business or management’s \nforecasts and assumptions). To assess the \nreasonableness of the discount rates used for each \nreporting unit, management compares the discount \nrate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded \ninstitutions with similar businesses and risk \ncharacteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost \nof equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is \ncompared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of \nequity for reasonableness. The valuations derived \nfrom the discounted cash flow analysis are then \ncompared with market-based trading and transaction \nmultiples for relevant competitors. Trading and \ntransaction comparables are used as general \nindicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the \nestimated fair values, although precise conclusions \ngenerally cannot be drawn due to the differences that \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n280\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

In evaluating this comparison, the Firm \nconsiders several factors, including (i) a control \npremium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) \nfactors related to the level of execution risk that would \nexist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the \nreporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility \nand other factors that do not directly affect the value of \nindividual reporting units.\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, \nincreases in credit losses, increases in capital \nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or \nmarket conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative \nchanges or increases in the estimated market cost of \nequity, could cause the estimated fair values of the \nFirm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which \ncould result in a material impairment loss to earnings \nin a future period related to some portion of the \nassociated goodwill. \nMortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash \nflows for performing servicing activities for others. The \nfair value considers estimated future servicing fees \nand ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to \nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as \nnet servicing cash flows are received, effectively \namortizing the MSR asset against contractual \nservicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either \npurchased from third parties or recognized upon sale \nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is \nretained.\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to \naccount for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its \nMSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the \navailability of market inputs used to measure the fair \nvalue of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as \none aggregate pool for risk management purposes. \nThe Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an \noption-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects \nMSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in \nconjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and \nthen discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. \nThe model considers portfolio characteristics, \ncontractually specified servicing fees, prepayment \nassumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late \ncharges and other ancillary revenue, and other \neconomic factors. The Firm compares fair value \nestimates and assumptions to observable market data \nwhere available, and also considers recent market \nactivity and actual portfolio experience. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n281",

These leases generally have terms \nof 20 years or less, determined based on the \ncontractual maturity of the lease, and include periods \ncovered by options to extend or terminate the lease \nwhen the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise \nthose options. All leases with lease terms greater than \ntwelve months are reported as a lease liability with a \ncorresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of \nthese lease agreements impose restrictions on the \nFirm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or \nequity financing transactions or enter into further lease \nagreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation \nclauses that will increase rental payments based on \nmaintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-\nlease components. The Firm elected not to separate \nlease and non-lease components of a contract for its \nreal estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments \nrepresent payments on both lease and non-lease \ncomponents. \nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are \nrecognized at the lease commencement date based \non the present value of the future minimum lease \npayments over the lease term. The future lease \npayments are discounted at a rate that estimates the \nFirm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing \ninstruments of a similar term and are included in \naccounts payable and other liabilities. The operating \nlease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises \nand equipment, also include any lease prepayments \nmade, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease \nincentives received.

The $30 billion common share repurchase \nprogram approved by the Board of Directors does not \nestablish specific price targets or timetables. \nManagement determines the amount and timing of \ncommon share repurchases based on various factors, \nincluding market conditions; legal and regulatory \nconsiderations affecting the amount and timing of \nrepurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking \ninto account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital \ngeneration; current and proposed future capital \nrequirements; and other investment opportunities. The \namount of common shares that the Firm repurchases \nin any period may be substantially more or less than \nthe amounts estimated or actually repurchased in \nprior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the \ndecision-making process.

This method \nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future \ntax consequences of temporary differences between \nthe carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book \nand tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or \nliability for each temporary difference is determined \nbased on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in \neffect when the underlying items of income and \nexpense are realized. JPMorganChase’s expense for \nincome taxes includes the current and deferred \nportions of that expense. A valuation allowance is \nestablished to reduce deferred tax assets to the \namount the Firm expects to realize. \nDue to the inherent complexities arising from the \nnature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting \nbusiness and being taxed in a substantial number of \njurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are \nrequired to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities \nbetween JPMorganChase and the many tax \njurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not \nbe finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-\nrelated assets and liabilities may ultimately be \ndifferent from those currently reported.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to \nthe Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit \nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization \nMethod guidance, under the modified retrospective \nmethod.

These restrictions are \nimposed by various regulatory authorities based on the \nparticular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. \nThe business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to \nexamination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a \nmember of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its \ndeposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to \napplicable limits. \nThe Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at \ncertain non-US central banks.  \nThe Firm is also subject to rules and regulations \nestablished by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators.

Such secured loans provided by \nany banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any \nparticular affiliate, together with certain other \ntransactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to \nas “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and \nconditions that are consistent with safe and sound \nbanking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with \ncash or US Government debt obligations, covered \ntransactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking \nsubsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-\nbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of \ncovered transactions between any banking subsidiary \nand all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking \nsubsidiary’s total capital.\nThe Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase \nHoldings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the \n“IHC”). The IHC generally holds the stock of \nJPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries.

The Parent Company is obligated to \ncontribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds \nreceived from securities issuances (including issuances \nof senior and subordinated debt securities and of \npreferred and common stock).\nThe principal sources of income and funding for the \nParent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from \nthe IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in \nstatutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC \nand the FDIC have authority under the Financial \nInstitutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the \npayment of dividends by the banking organizations they \nsupervise, including the Parent Company and its \nsubsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, \nif, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a \ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound \npractice in light of the financial condition of the banking \norganization. The IHC is prohibited from paying \ndividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if \ncertain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if \nlimits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s \nmanagement or Board of Directors.\nAt January 1, 2025, the Parent Company’s banking \nsubsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately \n$15.5 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding \ncompanies without the prior approval of their relevant \nbanking regulators.

The OCC \nestablishes similar minimum capital requirements and \nstandards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum \ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards \nfor large and internationally active U.S. bank holding \ncompanies and banks, including the Firm and \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the rules currently \nin effect, two comprehensive approaches are \nprescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized \napproach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced \napproach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of these risk-\nbased capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm \nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against \nthe lower of the Standardized or Advanced \napproaches compared to their respective regulatory \ncapital ratio requirements.\nThe three components of regulatory capital under the \nBasel III rules and their primary drivers are as \nillustrated below:\nUnder the risk-based capital and leverage-based \nguidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase & \nCo. is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 \ncapital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and \nthe SLR.

The contractual amount of these financial \ninstruments represents the maximum possible credit \nrisk to the Firm should the customer or client draw \nupon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill \nits obligation under the guarantee, and should the \ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform \naccording to the terms of the contract. Most of these \ncommitments and guarantees have historically been \nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without \nbeing drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the \ntotal contractual amount of these instruments is not, in \nthe Firm’s view, representative of its expected future \ncredit exposure or funding requirements. \nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and \ncertain consumer lending-related commitments, an \nallowance for credit losses on lending-related \ncommitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for \nfurther information regarding the allowance for credit \nlosses on lending-related commitments.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual \namounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet \nlending-related financial instruments, guarantees and \nother commitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nThe amounts in the table below for credit card, home \nequity  and certain scored business banking lending-\nrelated commitments represent the total available \ncredit for these products. The Firm has not \nexperienced, and does not anticipate, that all available \nlines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at \nthe same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these \ncommitments, in accordance with the contract, or to \nthe extent otherwise permitted by law, including  when \nthere has been a demonstrable decline in the \ncreditworthiness of the borrower or significant \ndecrease in the value of underlying property.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n302\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "Other unfunded commitments to extend credit \nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit \ngenerally consist of commitments for working capital \nand general corporate purposes, extensions of credit \nto support commercial paper facilities and bond \nfinancings in the event that those obligations cannot \nbe remarketed to new investors, as well as committed \nliquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm \nalso issues commitments under multipurpose facilities \nwhich could be drawn upon in several forms, including \nthe issuance of a standby letter of credit. \nGuarantees \nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the \ninception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal \nto the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing \nthe guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a \ncontract that contingently requires the guarantor to \npay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in \nan underlying asset, liability or equity security of the \nguaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to \nperform under a specified agreement. The Firm \nconsiders the following off–balance sheet \narrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: \nstandby letters of credit and other financial \nguarantees, securities lending indemnifications, \ncertain indemnification agreements included within \nthird-party contractual arrangements, certain \nderivative contracts and the guarantees under the \nsponsored member repo program. \nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records \nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-\ncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of \nconsideration received or the net present value of the \npremium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm \nrecords this fair value amount in other liabilities with an \noffsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums \nreceived), or other assets (for premiums receivable). \nAny premium receivable recorded in other assets is \nreduced as cash is received under the contract, and \nthe fair value of the liability recorded at inception is \namortized into income as lending and deposit-related \nfees over the life of the guarantee contract. The \nlending-related contingent obligation is recognized \nbased on expected credit losses in addition to, and \nseparate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are \nrecognized when the liability becomes probable and \nreasonably estimable. These obligations are not \nrecognized if the estimated amount is less than the \ncarrying amount of any non-contingent liability \nrecognized at inception (adjusted for any \namortization). Examples of non-lending-related \ncontingent obligations include indemnifications \nprovided in sales agreements, where a portion of the \nsale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which \nadjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result \nfrom the transaction. For these indemnifications, the \ninitial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk \nis reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification \nexpires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of \nguarantees and indemnifications are included in the \ntable on page 303.\nFor additional information on the guarantees, see \nbelow. \nStandby letters of credit and other financial \nguarantees \nStandby letters of credit and other financial \nguarantees are conditional lending commitments \nissued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a \nclient or customer to a third party under certain \narrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, \nbond financings, acquisition financings, trade \nfinancings and similar transactions. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other \nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2024 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees \n2023 Other letters of credit \nDecember 31,\n (in millions) \n2024 Standby letters of cr\nedit\n and other financial guarantees \n2024 Other let\nters of credit \n2023 Standby letters of cr\nedit\n and other financial guarantees \n2023 Other let\nters of credit \nInvestment-grade\n(a)\n$ \n20,443 \n$ \n3,380 \n$ \n19,694 \n$ \n3,552 \nNoninvestment-grade\n(a)\n \n8,233 \n \n974 \n \n9,178 \n \n836 \nTotal contractual amount\n$ \n28,676 \n$ \n4,354 \n$ \n28,872 \n$ \n4,388 \nAllowance for lending-related commitments\n$ \n94 \n$ \n37 \n$ \n110 \n$ \n37 \nGuarantee liability\n \n379 \n \n— \n \n369 \n \n— \nTotal carrying value\n$ \n473 \n$ \n37 \n$ \n479 \n$ \n37 \nCommitments with collateral\n$ \n16,805 \n$ \n357 \n$ \n16,861 \n$ \n539 \n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings.

      "text": "Securities lending indemnifications \nThrough the Firm’s securities lending program, \ncounterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-\ncustodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. \nAs part of this program, the Firm provides an \nindemnification in the lending agreements which \nprotects the lender against the failure of the borrower \nto return the lent securities. To minimize its liability \nunder these indemnification agreements, the Firm \nobtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a \nmarket value exceeding 100% of the value of the \nsecurities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is \nmarked to market daily to help assure that \ncollateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is \ncalled from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or \ncollateral may be released to the borrower in the event \nof overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm \nwould use the collateral held to purchase replacement \nsecurities in the market or to credit the lending client \nor counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. \nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested \non behalf of the client in indemnified resale \nagreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client \nagainst the loss of principal invested. To minimize its \nliability under these agreements, the Firm obtains \ncollateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the \nprincipal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees \nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that \nhave the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. \nGAAP. These contracts include written put options \nthat require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise \nby the option holder at a specified price by a specified \ndate in the future. The Firm may enter into written put \noption contracts in order to meet client needs, or for \nother trading purposes. The terms of written put \noptions are typically five years or less. \nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes \nstable value contracts, commonly referred to as \n“stable value products”, that require the Firm to make \na payment of the difference between the market value \nand the book value of a counterparty’s reference \nportfolio of assets in the event that market value is less \nthan book value and certain other conditions have \nbeen met. Stable value products are transacted in \norder to allow investors to realize investment returns \nwith less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These \ncontracts are typically longer-term or may have no \nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to \nterminate the contract under certain conditions. \nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally \nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, \nexposure to certain stable value products is \ncontractually limited to a substantially lower \npercentage of the notional amount. \nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the \nprobability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will \nbe required to perform under the contract. The Firm \nreduces exposures to these contracts by entering into \noffsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts \nthat hedge the market risk related to the derivative \nguarantees. \nThe following table summarizes the derivatives \nqualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2024 and \n2023.\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees\n$ \n49,628 \n$ \n54,562 \nStable value contracts with \ncontractually limited exposure\n \n32,939 \n \n32,488 \nMaximum exposure of stable \nvalue contracts with \ncontractually limited \nexposure\n \n1,740 \n \n1,652 \nFair value\nDerivative payables\n \n113 \n \n89 \nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the \ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a \npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit \nderivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further \ndiscussion of credit derivatives. \nUnsettled securities financing agreements \nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into \nresale and securities borrowed agreements. At \nsettlement, these commitments result in the Firm \nadvancing cash to and receiving securities collateral \nfrom the counterparty. The Firm also enters into \nrepurchase and securities loaned agreements. At \nsettlement, these commitments result in the Firm \nreceiving cash from and providing securities collateral \nto the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future \ndate. These agreements generally do not meet the \ndefinition of a derivative, and therefore, are not \nrecorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until \nsettlement date. These agreements predominantly  \nhave regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for \na further discussion of securities financing \nagreements. \nLoan sales- and securitization-related \nindemnifications \nMortgage repurchase liability \nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and \nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has \nmade representations and warranties that the loans \nsold meet certain requirements, and that may require \nthe Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or \nindemnify the loan purchaser if such representations \nand warranties are breached by the Firm. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n305",

      "text": "Private label securitizations\nThe liability related to repurchase demands associated \nwith private label securitizations is separately \nevaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation \nreserves. \nRefer to Note 30 for additional information regarding \nlitigation. \nLoans sold with recourse \nThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain \ncommercial lending products on both a recourse and \nnonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the \nprincipal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary \nservicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing \nadvances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees \nto share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage \nloans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private \ninvestor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse \nservicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales \nproceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan \nare less than the sum of the outstanding principal \nbalance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost \nof holding and disposing of the underlying property. \nThe Firm’s securitizations are predominantly \nnonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk \nof future credit losses to the purchaser of the \nmortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The \nunpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as \nwell as the carrying value of the related liability that the \nFirm has recorded in accounts payable and other \nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is \nrepresentative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will \nhave to perform under its recourse obligations, are \ndisclosed in the table on page 303.\nOther off-balance sheet arrangements \nIndemnification agreements – general \nIn connection with issuing securities to investors \noutside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional \namounts to the holders of the securities in the event \nthat, due to a change in tax law, certain types of \nwithholding taxes are imposed on payments on the \nsecurities. The terms of the securities may also give \nthe Firm the right to redeem the securities if such \nadditional amounts are payable. The Firm may also \nenter into indemnification clauses such as in \nconnection with the licensing of software to clients \n(“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or \nassets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), \npursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for \nclaims of liability or damages that may occur \nsubsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-\nparty purchasers for losses they may incur due to \nactions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the \nbusiness or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s \nmaximum exposure under these indemnification \narrangements, since this would require an assessment \nof future changes in tax law and future claims that may \nbe made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. \nHowever, based on historical experience, \nmanagement expects the risk of loss to be remote. \nMerchant charge-backs  \nUnder the rules of payment networks, in its role as a \nmerchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services \nbusiness in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability \nfor disputed processed credit and debit card \ntransactions that result in a charge-back to the \nmerchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s \nfavor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing \nbank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder \nand will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If \nthe Firm is unable to collect the amount from the \nmerchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount \ncredited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm \nmitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, \nretaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other \ncollateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation \nallowance that covers the payment or performance \nrisk related to charge-backs. \nClearing Services – Client Credit Risk \nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by \nentering into securities purchases and sales and \nderivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as \nfutures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative \ncontracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands \nbehind the performance of its clients, collects cash \nand securities collateral (margin) as well as any \nsettlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits \nthem to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. \nThere are two types of margin: variation margin is \nposted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ \nderivative contracts and initial margin is posted at \ninception of a derivative contract, generally on the \nbasis of the potential changes in the variation margin \nrequirement for the contract. \nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk \nof nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to \nclients for the performance of the CCPs. Where \npossible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client \nthrough the collection of appropriate amounts of \nmargin at inception and throughout the life of the \ntransactions. The Firm can also cease providing \nclearing services if clients do not adhere to their \nobligations under the clearing agreement. In the event \nof nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close \nout the client’s positions and access available margin. \nThe CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make \nitself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to \nbe paid by the Firm as a clearing member. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n306\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk \nof the client through the recognition of margin \nreceivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; \nthe clients’ underlying securities or derivative \ncontracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. \nIt is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible \nexposure through its role as a clearing member, as this \nwould require an assessment of transactions that \nclients may execute in the future. However, based \nupon historical experience, and the credit risk \nmitigants available to the Firm, management believes \nit is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any \nmaterial payments under these arrangements and the \nrisk of loss is expected to be remote. \nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that \nthe Firm executes for its own account and records in \nits Consolidated Financial Statements. \nExchange & Clearing House Memberships \nThe Firm is a member of several securities and \nderivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the \nU.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing \nservices to its clients. Membership in some of these \norganizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share \nof the losses incurred by the organization as a result of \nthe default of another member. Such obligations vary \nwith different organizations. These obligations may be \nlimited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of \nthe Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund \nmaintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of \nthe resources available to cover any losses in the event \nof a member default. Alternatively, these obligations \nmay also include a pro rata share of the residual losses \nafter applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain \nclearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a \npro rata share of losses that may result from the \nclearing house’s investment of guarantee fund \ncontributions and initial margin, unrelated to and \nindependent of the default of another \nmember. Generally a payment would only be required \nshould such losses exceed the resources of the \nclearing house or exchange that are contractually \nrequired to absorb the losses in the first instance. In \ncertain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s \nmaximum possible exposure under these membership \nagreements, since this would require an assessment of \nfuture claims that may be made against the Firm that \nhave not yet occurred. However, based on historical \nexperience, management expects the risk of loss to \nthe Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum \npossible exposure can be estimated, the amount is \ndisclosed in the table on page 303, in the Exchange & \nclearing house guarantees and commitments line.  \nSponsored member repo program \nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible \novernight and term resale and repurchase agreements \nthrough the Government Securities Division of the \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf \nof clients that become sponsored members under the \nFICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the \nprompt and full payment and performance of its \nsponsored member clients’ respective obligations \nunder the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability \nunder these guarantees by obtaining a security \ninterest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral \nthat the clients place with the clearing house; \ntherefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be \nremote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, \nwithout taking into consideration the associated \ncollateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house \nguarantees and commitments line on page 303. Refer \nto Note 11 for additional information on credit risk \nmitigation practices on resale agreements and the \ntypes of collateral pledged under repurchase \nagreements. \nGuarantees of subsidiaries \nIn the normal course of business, the Parent Company \nmay provide counterparties with guarantees of certain \nof the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries \non a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the \nFirm’s counterparties. The obligations of the \nsubsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated \nbalance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet \ncommitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not \nrecognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \nThe Firm believes that the occurrence of any event \nthat would trigger payments by the Parent Company \nunder these guarantees is remote. \nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-\nterm debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, \nincluding JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC \n(“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All \nsecurities issued by JPMFC are fully and \nunconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company \nand no other subsidiary of the Parent Company \nguarantees these securities.

      "text": "Note 30 – Litigation\nContingencies \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Firm and its subsidiaries \nand affiliates are defendants or respondents in \nnumerous evolving legal proceedings, including private \nproceedings, public proceedings, government \ninvestigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the \nmatters described below. The litigations range from \nindividual actions involving a single plaintiff to class \naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class \nmembers. Investigations and regulatory enforcement \nmatters involve both formal and informal proceedings, \nby both governmental agencies and self-regulatory \norganizations. These legal proceedings are at varying \nstages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and \ninvolve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several \ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including \ncommon law tort and contract claims and statutory \nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), \nsome of which present novel legal theories.\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range \nof reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves \nestablished, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to \napproximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024. This \nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible \nlosses was based upon information available as of that \ndate for those proceedings in which the Firm believes \nthat an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be \nmade. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe \nthat such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The \nFirm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably \npossible losses involves significant judgment, given:\n• the number, variety and varying stages of the \nproceedings, including the fact that many are in \npreliminary stages, \n• the existence in many such proceedings of multiple \ndefendants, including the Firm, whose share of \nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \n• the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the \nproceedings, including issues regarding class \ncertification and the scope of many of the claims, and \n• the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of \nsuch proceedings, including where the Firm has made \nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or \nother adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives \nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those \nassumptions prove to be incorrect.\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may \nbe a result which the Firm did not take into account in its \nestimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of \nthat outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s \nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible \nlosses will change from time to time, and actual losses \nmay vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material \nlegal proceedings.\n1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as \na defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in \nMalaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a \nMalaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. \nThe claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. \nMorgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of \n$300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, \nrespectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an \naccount at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB \nPetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between \n1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In \nMarch 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to \nthe validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s \njurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been \nappealed by 1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an \napplication by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with \npermission to re-file a new claim in the future. That \ndecision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and \nan appeals court is scheduled to hear both appeals in \nNovember 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent \nany claim from continuing.   \nIn addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the \nAttorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. \nMorgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an \ninvestigation into possible criminal liability in \nconnection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan \n(Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi \njoint venture and its related persons for the period \nSeptember 2009 through August 2015. The OAG \ninvestigation is ongoing. \nAmrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is \ninvestigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in \nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by \ntwo offshore funds formerly managed by \nJPMorganChase entities into residential housing \nprojects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) \nrelating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver \nresidential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order \nfining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately \n$31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. \nRelatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India \nissued an order making preliminary findings that \nAmrapali and other parties, including unspecified \nJPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that had \ninvested in the projects, violated certain criminal \ncurrency control and money laundering provisions, and \nordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is \nresponding to and cooperating with the inquiry.   \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The \nFirm previously reported settlements with certain \ngovernment authorities relating to its foreign exchange \n(“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to \nthose activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, \nthe Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal \nantitrust law.

The only remaining FX-related governmental \ninquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission \nmatter which is currently pending before the South \nAfrica Competition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related \nindividual and putative class actions filed outside the \nU.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil \nand Australia, remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of \nAppeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's \nearlier denial of a request for class certification on an \nopt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this \ndecision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a \nsettlement in principle has been reached on the \nputative class action, which remains subject to court \napproval. \nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail \nassociations filed a series of class action complaints \nalleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain \nbanks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit \ncard interchange fees and enacted related rules in \nviolation of antitrust laws.\nIn September 2018, the parties settled the class action \nseeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively \ncontributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement \nhas been approved by the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on \nappeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that \nopted out of the settlement, $700 million has been \nreturned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. \nA separate class action seeking injunctive relief \ncontinues, and in September 2021, the District Court \ngranted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, \nand denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District \nCourt denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the \ninjunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard \nagreed to certain changes to their respective network \nrules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates \nfor U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering \nnext steps. \nOf the merchants who opted out of the damages class \nsettlement, certain merchants filed individual actions \nraising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, \nas well as against the Firm and other banks. While some \nof those actions remain pending, the defendants have \nreached settlements with the merchants who opted out \nrepresenting over 70% of the combined Mastercard-\nbranded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and \nLitigation. JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries \nfrom various governmental agencies and entities \naround the world relating primarily to the British \nBankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank \nOffered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the \nEuropean Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered \nRate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition \nCommission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to \nwhich the Firm and one other bank remain subject, \ncontinues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 \ndecision by the European Commission against the Firm \nand other banks finding an infringement of European \nantitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, \nthe European General Court annulled the fine imposed \nby the European Commission, but exercised its \ndiscretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In \nMarch 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision \nwith the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant \nalong with other banks in various individual and putative \nclass actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. \ndollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR \nduring the period that it was administered by the BBA, \nthe United States District Court for the Southern District \nof New York granted class certification of antitrust \nclaims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold \ndirectly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm \nhas obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved \ncertain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has \nmoved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit \nfiled by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust \nclaims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants \nwere engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. \ndollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market \nfor LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was \ndismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nin December 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. \ndollar LIBOR actions.\nRussian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with \ninternational sanctions laws, which mandate the \nblocking of certain assets. These laws apply when \nassets associated with individuals, companies, products \nor services are within the scope of the sanctions. The \nFirm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia \nseeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, \nand is contractually excused from paying as a result of, \nrelevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and \nclaims filed against other financial institutions, Russian \ncourts have disregarded the parties’ contractual \nagreements concerning forum selection and did not \nrecognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not \nmaking payment. Russian courts have entered \njudgment against the Firm in a number of claims, \nincluding one for $439 million, and a judgment has been \nexecuted against assets held onshore by the Firm in \nRussia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the \ntotal amount of available assets that the Firm holds in \nRussia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian \ncourts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed \nwhile on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered \ninterim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, \namong other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, \nshares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of \nthe named defendants) pending a determination of \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n310\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

The Firm has \nchallenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts \nand related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided \nfor by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If further \nclaims are enforced despite the actions taken by the \nFirm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the \nproper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia \ncould be seized in full, and certain client assets could \nalso be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from \ncomplying with its obligations.\nSEC Inquiries. In October 2024, the Firm entered into \nsettlements with the SEC to resolve inquiries related to, \namong other things, conflict disclosures concerning the \nselection of portfolio managers and the timing of the \nFirm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain \ninvestment vehicles that invest in third-party managed \nprivate funds and certain other matters. The resolutions \nrequired the Firm to pay a combined $151 million in civil \npenalties and voluntary payments to customers. The \nFirm continues to cooperate in connection with SEC \ninquiries concerning the aggregation of accounts for fee \nbilling and various other matters.\nShareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative \nclass actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions \npurporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed \nagainst the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its \ncurrent and former officers.  \nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical \ntrading practices by former employees in the precious \nmetals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct \nwhich were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the \nDOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary \nactivities that were separately the subject of a resolution \nbetween JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in \nNovember 2020. One of these shareholder derivative \nsuits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New \nYork in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty \nand unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical \ntrading practices and related conduct and fiduciary \nactivities which were the subject of the resolutions \ndescribed above. In December 2022, the court granted \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in \nJuly 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains \npending. \nA second shareholder derivative action relating to the \nhistorical trading practices and related conduct was \nfiled in the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York in December 2022. Defendants \nhave moved to dismiss the complaint.\nZelle Network Litigation. In December 2024, the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) filed a \ncomplaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”), \nBank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District \nCourt for the District of Arizona. The CFPB alleges that \nEWS and the defendant banks have failed to take \nsufficient efforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. \nThe defendants will file a response to the complaint.\n*     *     *\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed \nabove, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named \nas defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial \nnumber of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it \nhas meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against \nit in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it \nintends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal \nproceedings may be initiated from time to time in the \nfuture.\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred \nof its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In \naccordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for \ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related \nliability when it is probable that such a liability has been \nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably \nestimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal \nproceedings each quarter to assess its litigation \nreserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, \nupward or downward, as appropriate, based on \nmanagement’s best judgment after consultation with \ncounsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $740 million, \n$1.4 billion and $266 million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There \nis no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will \nnot need to be adjusted in the future. \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the \noutcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the \nclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or \nwhere the matters present novel legal theories, involve \na large number of parties or are in early stages of \ndiscovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what \nwill be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending \nmatters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the \neventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences \nrelated to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, \nbased upon its current knowledge and after \nconsultation with counsel, consideration of the material \nlegal proceedings described above and after taking into \naccount its current litigation reserves and its estimated \naggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal \nproceedings currently pending against it should not \nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm’s \nconsolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, \nhowever, that in light of the uncertainties involved in \nsuch proceedings, there is no assurance that the \nultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly \nexceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a \nmatter will not have material reputational \nconsequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular \nmatter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating \nresults for a particular period, depending on, among \nother factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and \nthe level of JPMorganChase’s income for that period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n311",

      "text": "Description of business segment reporting \nmethodology\nResults of the reportable business segments are \nintended to present each segment as if it were a stand-\nalone business. The management reporting process \nthat derives business segment results includes the \nallocation of certain income and expense items. The \nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions, \nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for \nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements \nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also \nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on \nat least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide \nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the Firm \nand its investors and analysts in assessing \nperformance. \nRevenue sharing \nWhen business segments or businesses within each \nsegment join efforts to sell products and services to \nthe Firm’s clients and customers, the participating \nbusinesses may agree to share revenue from those \ntransactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the \nsegment responsible for the related product or \nservice, with allocations to the other segments or \nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment \nand business results reflect these revenue-sharing \nagreements.\nExpense allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by \nCorporate support units, or another business segment, \nthe costs of those services are allocated to the \nrespective business segments. The expense is \ngenerally allocated based on the actual cost and use of \nservices provided. In contrast, certain costs and \ninvestments related to Corporate that are not currently \nutilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business \nsegments and are retained in Corporate. Expense \nretained in Corporate generally includes costs that \nwould not be incurred if the segments were stand-\nalone businesses, and other items not solely aligned \nwith a particular reportable business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which \nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the \nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary \ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the \ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets \nand liabilities and off-balance sheet products. \nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions \nutilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect \neconomic conditions and other factors, which may \nimpact the allocation of net interest income to the \nsegments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the \nFirm updated its FTP with respect to consumer \ndeposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding \nbenefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that \nis fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s \nnet interest income.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs \nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain \nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages \nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign \nexchange rate movements related to the transferred \nrisk in its results.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the \ncredit spread component of outstanding unsecured \nlong-term debt and preferred stock dividends is \nallocated to the reportable business segments, while \nthe balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The \nmethodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-\nterm debt and preferred stock dividends to the \nbusiness segments is aligned with the relevant \nregulatory capital requirements and funding needs of \nthe LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of \nunsecured long-term debt is included in a business \nsegment’s net interest income, and net income is \nreduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a \nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common \nequity.\nCapital allocation\nEach LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking \ninto consideration a variety of factors including capital \nlevels of similarly rated peers and applicable \nregulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and \ninternal targets for expected returns are established \nas key measures of an LOB’s performance.\nThe Firm’s current equity allocation methodology \nincorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB \nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well \nas a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress \nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions, \njudgments and methodologies used to allocate capital \nare reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to \nthe LOBs and Corporate may change. \nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n314\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts \nwith the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes \ncertain reclassifications to present total net revenue \nfor the Firm as a whole (and for each of the reportable \nbusiness segments and Corporate) on an FTE basis. \nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive \ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in \nthe managed results on a basis comparable to taxable \ninvestments and securities. This allows management \nto assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-\nyear arising from both taxable and tax-exempt \nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related \nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax \nexpense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact \non net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by \nthe each of the LOBs and Corporate.\nThe Operating Committee reviews segment results \nincluding net interest income, noninterest revenue, \nnoninterest expense, provision for credit losses and \nnet income on a managed basis.

      "text": "Note 34 – Business combinations\nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorganChase acquired certain \nassets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic \nBank (the \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. \nThe acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, \nwhich represents the excess of the estimated fair value \nof the net assets acquired above the purchase price. \nThe Firm has determined that this acquisition \nconstitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. \nAccordingly, the initial recognition of the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed were generally \nmeasured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, \n2023. The determination of those fair values required \nmanagement to make certain market-based \nassumptions about expected future cash flows, \ndiscount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of \nthe acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value \nestimates of the assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed provide a reasonable basis for determining \nthe estimated bargain purchase gain. \nThe First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary \nestimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The \nfinal bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion reflects \nadjustments of $103 million and $63 million for the \nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, made during the one-year measurement \nperiod, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize \nmanagement's fair value estimates for the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, \n2024, certain matters related to the final settlement \nremained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. \nOn January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement \nwith the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding \nitems. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a \npayment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, \n2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, \nwhich will result in a gain of approximately \n$600 million to be recorded in other income in the first \nquarter of 2025.\nIn connection with the First Republic acquisition, the \nFirm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss \nagreements with respect to certain loans and lending-\nrelated commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the \nCommercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the \nSingle-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The \nCSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu \nbasis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery \nperiod for certain acquired commercial loans and \nother real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of \ncredit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7 years for \ncertain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real \nproperty or shares in cooperative property \nconstituting a primary residence. The indemnification \nassets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and \nSFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total \nassets acquired.\nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase \nissued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC \n(the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money \nNote bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is \nsecured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase \nMoney Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder.\nThe Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First \nRepublic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion \nof deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. \nbanks. The Firm's $5 billion deposit was effectively \nsettled as part of the acquisition and the associated \nallowance for credit losses was released upon closing. \nThe Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $25 \nbillion of deposits to the consortium of banks, \nincluding accrued interest through the payment date \non May 9, 2023.\n \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n319",

The core deposit \nintangible of $1.3 billion was valued by discounting \nestimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining \nuseful life of the deposits using the favorable source of \nfunds method. The after-tax cost savings were \nestimated based on the difference between the cost of \nmaintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost \nof next best alternative funding sources available to \nmarket participants. The customer relationship \nintangibles of $180 million were valued by discounting \nestimated after-tax earnings over their remaining \nuseful lives using the multi-period excess earnings \nmethod. Both intangible asset valuations utilized \nassumptions that the Firm believes a market \nparticipant would use to estimate fair values, such as \ngrowth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well \nas related costs to service the relationships, and \ndiscount rates. The core deposit and customer \nrelationship intangibles are amortized over a projected \nperiod of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. \nRefer to Note 15 for further discussion on other \nintangible assets.\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n320\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",

      "text": "The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between \nvolume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the \ntable and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 322-325 for more information on average balances and rates). \nIn this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual \nrates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various \nproducts within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without \nconsideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets \nand the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in \nthis analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of \nchanges in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.\n2024 versus 2023 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Volume \n2023 versus 2022 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Rate \n(Unaudited)\n2024 versus 2023 Inc\nrease/(decrease) due to change in: Volume \n2023 versus 2022 Inc\nrease/(decrease) due to change in: Rate \nYear ended December 31,\n (On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) \n2024 versus 2023 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Volume \n2024 versus 2023 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Rate \n2024 versus 2023 Net change \n2024 versus 2023 Net change \n2023 versus 2022 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Volume \n2023 versus 2022 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Rate \n2023 versus 2022 Net change \n2023 versus 2022 Net change \nInterest-earning assets\nDeposits with banks:\nU.S.\n$ \n(636) $ \n445 \n$ \n(191) \n$ \n(8,225) $ \n16,155 \n$ \n7,930 \nNon-U.S.\n \n83 \n \n608 \n \n691 \n \n(361)  \n5,189 \n \n4,828 \nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale \nagreements:\nU.S.\n \n2,092 \n \n264 \n \n2,356 \n \n1,347 \n \n4,792 \n \n6,139 \nNon-U.S.\n \n184 \n \n680 \n \n864 \n \n(629)  \n4,937 \n \n4,308 \nSecurities borrowed:\nU.S.\n \n797 \n \n294 \n \n1,091 \n \n(411)  \n4,839 \n \n4,428 \nNon-U.S.\n \n(3)  \n137 \n \n134 \n \n(95)  \n1,413 \n \n1,318 \nTrading assets – debt instruments:\nU.S.\n \n2,659 \n \n199 \n \n2,858 \n \n3,358 \n \n1,949 \n \n5,307 \nNon-U.S.\n \n834 \n \n680 \n \n1,514 \n \n666 \n \n931 \n \n1,597 \nInvestment securities:\nU.S.\n \n(47)  \n4,036 \n \n3,989 \n \n(1,690)  \n8,165 \n \n6,475 \nNon-U.S.\n \n310 \n \n91 \n \n401 \n \n228 \n \n651 \n \n879 \nLoans:\n \nU.S.\n \n5,326 \n \n3,411 \n \n8,737 \n \n10,296 \n \n17,635 \n \n27,931 \nNon-U.S.\n \n(26)  \n288 \n \n262 \n \n(258)  \n3,039 \n \n2,781 \nAll other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S.\n \n240 \n \n396 \n \n636 \n \n(3,749)  \n7,655 \n \n3,906 \nChange in interest income\n \n11,813 \n \n11,529 \n \n23,342 \n \n477 \n \n77,350 \n \n77,827 \nInterest-bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nU.S.\n \n340 \n \n6,580 \n \n6,920 \n \n(1,284)  \n20,511 \n \n19,227 \nNon-U.S.\n \n1,194 \n \n1,429 \n \n2,623 \n \n597 \n \n10,110 \n \n10,707 \nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under \nrepurchase agreements:\nU.S.\n \n5,271 \n \n39 \n \n5,310 \n \n1,293 \n \n6,263 \n \n7,556 \nNon-U.S.\n \n480 \n \n100 \n \n580 \n \n(480)  \n2,462 \n \n1,982 \nTrading liabilities – debt, short-term and all other interest-\nbearing liabilities:\nU.S.\n \n659 \n \n(144)  \n515 \n \n409 \n \n4,981 \n \n5,390 \nNon-U.S.\n \n380 \n \n154 \n \n534 \n \n(17)  \n1,924 \n \n1,907 \nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, \npredominantly U.S.\n \n409 \n \n21 \n \n430 \n \n381 \n \n346 \n \n727 \nLong-term debt:\nU.S.\n \n2,483 \n \n528 \n \n3,011 \n \n2,494 \n \n5,229 \n \n7,723 \nNon-U.S.\n \n77 \n \n29 \n \n106 \n \n(3)  \n8 \n \n5 \nChange in interest expense\n \n11,293 \n \n8,736 \n \n20,029 \n \n3,390 \n \n51,834 \n \n55,224 \nChange in net interest income\n$ \n520 \n$ \n2,793 \n$ \n3,313 \n$ \n(2,913) $ \n25,516 \n$ 22,603 \n \nChanges in net interest income, volume and rate analysis\n326\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K\n2024 versus 2023 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Rate \n2023 versus 2022 Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Volume \n2024 versus 2023 Net change \n2023 versus 2022 Net change \n2024 versus 2023 Inc\nrease/(decrease) due to change in: Rate \n2023 versus 2022 Inc\nrease/(decrease) due to change in: Volume",

A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans \nare those where a borrower does not provide complete \ndocumentation of his or her assets or the amount or \nsource of his or her income. \nOption ARMs \nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an \nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the \nborrower with the option each month to make a fully \namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The \nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on \nthe interest rate charged during the introductory \nperiod. This introductory rate is usually significantly \nbelow the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is \ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the \nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest rate \ncharged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate \nand adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. \nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover \ninterest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid \ninterest is deferred and added to the principal balance \nof the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment \nrecast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully \namortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance \nand anniversary date triggers. \nPrime \nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good \ncredit records who meet specific underwriting \nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements \nrelated to income and overall debt levels. New prime \nmortgage borrowers provide full documentation and \ngenerally have reliable payment histories. \nSubprime \nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were \noffered to certain customers with one or more high risk \ncharacteristics, including but not limited to: (i) \nunreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio \nof greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage \ninsurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an \noccupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s \nGlossary of Terms and Acronyms\n330\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K",
