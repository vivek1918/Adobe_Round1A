Hence, SER research does not facilitate clear\nconclusions on bi/multilingual (the term ‘multilingual’ is used henceforth) education and its effec-\ntiveness. Despite the intensiﬁcation of multilingual education research over the last four decades,\nonly a few authors and studies have focused on offering a compact overview of what factors need to\nbe in place for the programs to be effective. These works are neither recent nor systematic. In this\narticle, we aim to contribute to this research gap by systematically reviewing the research evidence\non speciﬁc factors explaining multilingual student success in multilingual education programs. The\nﬁndings of this systematic literature review integrate the current evidence regarding the critical\nfactors conducive to student success in multilingual education. The results reveal that the reviewed\nstudies mostly discussed school level factors and only occasionally talked about state/regional or\nindividual level factors. We also underscore the critical role of leadership in making multilingual\neducation successful. The implications of this review are twofold: by using a conceptual framework\nto discuss the success factors, the interdependence of the variables shaping multilingual education is\nhighlighted, while the results collect the latest evidence for decision makers in multilingual education.\nKeywords: multilingual education; bilingual education; effective schools; effectiveness factors;\nliterature review\n1. Introduction\nThe intensiﬁcation of the research on bi- or multilingual education has been reﬂected\nin the dynamics in international migration patterns. Over the last four and a half decades,\nthe number of international migrants has almost tripled around the world [1], and the\nresearch published in the ﬁeld of bi- or multilingual education has increased at a similar\nrate according to the Web of Science records [2].\nThe research evidence is rather unanimous on issues, such as the superiority of well-\nimplemented bilingual programs over monolingual ones; the key importance of using the\nstudent’s ﬁrst language (L1) for an extensive period of time in bilingual programs; and\nthe precedence of two- or one-way immersion programs over other types of approaches\n(for a most recent overview see [3]). However, despite a lengthy tradition of inquiry, the\nresearch remains vague on the question of what speciﬁc factors need to be in place to make\nmultilingual education effective.\nConsequently, Uchikoshi and Maniates [4] called for more empirical work on the\nquality of program implementation “to understand the explanatory variables for academic\nsuccess in bilingual programs”. Likewise, Valentino and Reardon [5] underscored that\nresearch on various bilingual instructional models has left unanswered the question of\nwhich components make the programs work.\nIn this article, we aim to contribute to this research gap by reviewing the research\nevidence on speciﬁc factors explaining multilingual student success in bi-/multilingual\nEduc.

Through\na systematic literature review, a summary of factors will be presented.\n2. Multilingual Education and Effective Schools\nTraditionally, in education research, school effectiveness scholars have been the ones\noccupied with the question of speciﬁc factors explaining success. Effective school research\n(ESR), a strand of the wider school effectiveness research paradigm, has aimed to identify\nthe processes of effective schooling [6]. ESR has attempted to explain how successful schools\nfunction differently from less successful ones. Reynolds and Teddlie [7] summarized that\neffective schools were characterized by nine process factors: effective leadership, effective\nteaching, a pervasive focus on learning, a positive school culture, high expectations for all,\nstudent responsibilities and rights, progress monitoring, developing school staff skills, and\ninvolving parents.\nHowever, ESR has been only marginally addressed in multilingual education contexts.\nA research review of the major context factors studied in school effectiveness concluded that,\nmost often, socioeconomic status is under review followed by less researched contextual\nfactors, such as community type, grade phase, and governance structures [8]. Consequently,\nthe language aspect has not been identiﬁed as a major category of contextual variables in\nthe ESR paradigm. At the same time, scholars of multilingual education have claimed that\nthese factors should take precedence before more speciﬁc effectiveness variables can be\ndiscussed [9,10].\nThe studies on multilingual school effectiveness have evolved separately from ESR.\nCarter and Chatﬁeld [11] were some of the early authors to make an interconnection with\nbilingual education programs and school effectiveness by proposing a Bilingual/Effectiveness\nParadigm. They raised a question regarding the interdependence of bilingual education\nprograms and the schools they were situated in. They concluded that “the school does\nnot make the bilingual program effective; neither does the program make the school\neffective. The program, as an integral part of school activities, contributes to and mirrors\nthe overall effectiveness.” [11] Still, it seems that these aspects have not been given enough\nconsideration as researchers on multilingual education still make claims regarding a lack\nof evidence in this area [4,5].\nThe analysis of contextual factors has mostly received attention in ethnographic\nstudies that provide more thorough descriptions of multilingual education in particular\nsettings; however, these have been rather few in number (see May [3] for an overview).\nThere have been a few studies that focused on summarizing the evidence on multilin-\ngual education variables. However, most of these are not very recent. In 1992, Christina\nBratt Paulston carried out a paradigmatic analysis of bilingual education and concluded\nthat the independent (causal), dependent (outcome), and intervening variables of bilingual\neducation programs depended on the world view of the researcher [12]. The US National\nResearch Council identiﬁed, in their 1997 study, 13 factors characterizing effective schools\nfor English-language learners [13].\nMaria Estela Brisk published an extensive book in 2006 addressing all possible factors\naffecting the functioning of quality bilingual education [14]. In her book, Brisk concluded\nher study of inﬂuential variables with a Framework for School Evaluation where she listed\n26 factors at school, curricula, and instruction levels for schools to evaluate and follow as\ncritical for quality bilingual schooling. Additionally, Baker [15] discussed key topics in\neffective bilingual schools.\nAs Bratt Paulston’s [12] work was not aimed at summarizing the available evidence\nand those by Baker [15], Brisk [14], and the US National Research Council [13] were not\nsystematic reviews and are somewhat outdated by now, a refreshed look at the most recent\nworks on the effectiveness of multilingual education appeared necessary. Additionally,\nduring the times of information overload and the diversiﬁcation of the student popu-\nlations [16], education policy makers are in critical need of up-to-date and trustworthy",

Additionally, this type of research would suggest to what extent the factors are\nunder the control of school leaders.\nConsequently, based on the need to (a) map the contemporary state of the ﬁeld of\neffectiveness in multilingual education and (b) to compile evidence for actors in multi-\nlingual education, a literature review with the aim of providing an overview of factors\nshaping the effectiveness of multilingual education was conducted. The research question\nto be addressed was: which factors are associated with the effectiveness of multilingual\neducation?\n3. The Conceptual Framework of the Factors Shaping Multilingual Education\nSeveral authors researching multilingual education [17–21] have conceptualized and\nproposed factors affecting the functioning of multilingual education. These conceptualiza-\ntions vary extensively in terms of their content, level of analysis, and the variables covered\n(see also [22]). There is no apparent consensus among the researchers in the ﬁeld regarding\nhow the factors shaping the operation of multilingual education should be viewed and\nconceptualized.\nBased on this need, we proposed a conceptual framework (for an overview, see [22])\nthat would comprehensively cover the different levels of analysis and functioning (macro,\nmeso, and micro) of multilingual education, differentiating between variables based on\ntheir types (inputs, processes, and outcomes). Adopting a system view of the framework,\nthis framework allows a systematic analysis of the factors at play in multilingual education\nas well as reviewing to what extent different levels and types of factors function in a\nconsistent manner.\nFigure 1 below provides a visual overview of the factors and the main sub-factors.\nThe literature review provided in the later sections of the paper uses this conceptual\nframework as a basis for the analysis: all of the factors located in the literature review\nprocess are recorded under these categories and sub-categories. Using this framework\nenables an overview of what types of factors, at what levels, occur in studies dealing with\nthe effectiveness of multilingual education.\n \nFigure 1.

Method\nA systematic literature review search was carried out in September 2018 as part of\nthe RITA-Ränne research and development project in Estonia. The following search terms\nwere used: ‘bilingual education’ OR ‘multilingual education’ AND effective*. The choice of\nsearch terms was based on the idea that the most common and used terms were included,\nwhile the more speciﬁc alternatives that refer to particular types of bilingual education\n(e.g., two-/one-way immersion, dual-language education, content and language integrated\nlearning, sheltered instruction, etc.) were excluded.\nThe inclusion of all possible versions and types of multilingual education would\nhave made the search immensely extensive. The search term ‘effective’ was purposefully\nincluded to limit the search to studies that try to address factors explaining the success of\nmultilingual education; this was also directly in line with the research question. Detailed\nPICO was not implemented as bi/multilingual education is not a clear-cut intervention;\nthus, PICO was not deemed appropriate to apply.\nThe academic databases the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, EBSCO ACA-\nDEMIC SEARCH COMPLETE, and ERIC were used for the search. The search criteria\nincluded peer-reviewed journal articles; additionally, books and book series were included\nin Scopus (as this was an available option); conference proceedings were excluded as these\nwere not considered to be of the same academic quality as journals and books. Only English\nlanguage sources were included.\nThe databases’ search yielded a total of 719 publications; with the removal of dupli-\ncates, 599 publications remained (see Figure 2 below). Then, a ﬁrst screening based on title\nand abstract was carried out using the following inclusion (eligibility) criteria:\n•\nBi/multilingual education: the study addressed multilingual (or any sub-type of this)\neducation.\n•\nGeneral school education: the study involved students in K12 education.\n•\nRegular education: the students were involved in regular and not in special needs\neducation.\n•\nType of study: the study was an empirical investigation of multilingual education and\nnot a theoretical piece of writing; also, book reviews were excluded.\n•\nEffectiveness of multilingual research: the study explicitly dealt with effectiveness or\nsome aspect of the effectiveness of multilingual education.\n•\nExplanatory nature: the study addressed factors affecting the effectiveness of mul-\ntilingual education and did not only compare different types of programs and their\neffectiveness.\n•\nLanguage of study: only papers in English were included.\nThe screening was carried out with the EPPI-Reviewer 4 program [23]. At the title and\nabstract stage of screening, two coders were used for reviewing the search results. Out of\nthe 599 articles, 323 (54%) were co-coded by both coders to increase the trustworthiness of\nresults. Of the 323 articles co-coded, 236 (73%) were coded similarly. In case of disagree-\nments (87 articles, 27%), a reconciliation was done in cooperation with the two coders: the\narticles under disagreement were again revised and then the ﬁnal decision was made on\ninclusion/exclusion.\nThe title and abstract screening resulted in 98 included articles; out of these, 31 were\nnot accessible in full text to the authors and had to be excluded from further analysis. Then,\nthe full text screening of 67 articles was carried out.\nThe full text screening ended up with 16 included articles; additionally, eight more\nstudies that were previously known to the authors and that did not show up in the search\nwere included in the review process. These additionally included studies were mostly of\nthree types: well-known and recognized longitudinal studies in the ﬁeld that had not been\npublished in journals [24,25]; research reports carried out or commissioned by national\ngovernment agencies [26,27]; and studies located during a previous literature search done\non the theoretical framework for multilingual education [28–31].",

The\ntables in Appendix A (Tables A1–A3) provide an overview of the included studies.\nThe data analysis process of the 24 included articles was largely based on the PRISMA\nchecklist [32], and a detailed review of the writings in terms of the research objective, the\nresearch questions/hypothesis posed, the research object, the theoretical framework used,\nand the variables (input, process, and output) addressed was performed for each study.\nAdditionally, the location, target group, sample size, methodology, type of evidence,\naspects of reliability/trustworthiness, and main conclusions were recorded for each study.\nThe studies were also categorized into study types: quantitative (11), qualitative (7), and\nmixed (6) method studies (cf. Appendix A Tables A1–A3). After that, the data were\nanalyzed based on the categories outlined in Figure 1, e.g., all macro level resource factors\nfound were put together and analyzed in terms of what aspects of resources were discussed\nin the articles found.\nAfter this review process, the results were systematized based on the developed\nanalytical framework of the factors shaping multilingual education (see Figure 1).\n5. Results\nBefore starting to uncover the particular ﬁndings of the study, we brieﬂy discuss the\nmore general nature and content of the studies reviewed to provide a backdrop to the\nfactors discussed later. The majority of studies found were conducted in the USA, with\ntwo meta-analytic studies covering the whole world.\nThe origins of the studies have clear implications on how the research objects were\nframed in the reviewed writings. The majority of studies (11 out of 24) had a set focus\non analyzing English (language) learners, followed by an equivalent of limited English\nlanguage proﬁcient (6) students—both terms mostly used in the US context. However,\nthe rest of the studies used a wide array of research object terms (e.g., English as second\nlanguage (learners) or L2 learners, dual language learners, language minority students,\nimmigrant students, emergent bilinguals, and bilingual learners).\nThe framing of the research objects often allows an assumption of what kind of\ntheoretical stance has been taken by the authors. In this case, the most frequently used\ntheoretical framework was bilingual education theory; however, closely related theories of\nEnglish language/second language learning, dual language learning, and foreign language",

However, the variety of theories emerging\nwas rather large—depending on the research questions applied, certain theories were more\nspeciﬁc in focusing on pedagogical practices or language learning strategies. Theoretical\nframeworks from sociocultural approaches, bioecological research, and psycholinguistics\nwere also represented.\nThe following sections discuss the research results based on the conceptual frame-\nwork outlined in Figure 1. The results reﬂect the state of the available research as of\nSeptember 2018.\n5.1. Outcome Variables Used in Effective Multilingual Schools’ Research\nBefore moving to the discussion of effectiveness variables, an overview of the output\nor outcome measures applied in the reviewed articles is provided. The output variables\nindicate how various authors have approached the concept of effectiveness and what has\nbeen deﬁned as success in multilingual education. This not only provides an overview\nof the types of measures used to deﬁne effectiveness or success but also outlines a wider\ncontextual background for the input and process factors discussed in the following sections.\nTable 1 below summarizes the output/outcome indicators used and proposed in the\nreviewed articles. On the one hand, the variety of indicators is rather extensive in outlining\nthe multitude of possibilities to approach the outputs of multilingual education. On the\nother hand, the review clearly indicates that the focus of outputs was predominantly on\nlanguage skills and/or academic achievement in major curriculum subjects.\nHowever, the review of output indicators was revealing in the sense that other outputs\nin addition to academic ones were rarely under review for researchers. Multilingual\neducation often promotes other types of objectives (e.g., the appreciation of diversity,\nintercultural competence, etc.); however, as seen from these reviews, these outputs were\nnot often included in the multilingual education effectiveness concepts.\nTable 1.

[26] and Mehisto and Asser [35]—\nmade reference to macro level issues. At the state level, Mehisto and Asser’s [35] study\nindicated that schools regarded it important to have national guidelines and support\nsystems in place for implementing multilingual education.\nBerman et al. [26] found that all reviewed states had regulations in place that ordered\nschools to have special programs for students with limited English proﬁciency. This\nmeant that schools with a certain number of limited English speakers had to implement\ntargeted programs for these students. In some cases, regulations also presented speciﬁc\nrequirements for teacher credentials (training). The practices at the district level were more\nvaried, but overall, districts of exemplary schools stood out with their support for students’\ndevelopment of bilingualism and biliteracy underscoring the ideology of additive language\nlearning.\nBerman et al. [26] also found evidence of a belief in limited English proﬁcient students’\nhigh achievement by district management personnel. Another indicator of the policy steps\ntaken were the extended autonomy and accountability of decision making to individual\nschools, thus trusting the schools with ﬁnding the best solutions for their student body. In\ncertain cases, adjustments in regulations (e.g., class size limits) were offered to support\nschools.\nAt the school level, exemplary multilingual schools were characterized by a clear\nmultilingual language policy focus of the school. García et al. [36] identiﬁed a ‘bilingualism\nin education’ policy at the researched schools that sought to ﬂexibly address the various\nneeds of bilingual learners. The schools that Alanis and Rodriguez [37] and de Jong [38]\nresearched had explicitly stated the goals of multilingualism and multiculturalism in their\npolicy documents. Not only was multilingualism stated as a goal at effective schools but\nschool policies also reﬂected that multilingualism is a valuable resource per se, i.e., an\nenrichment ideology was being followed [37]. At the same time, Alanis and Rodriguez [37]\nalso noticed how language development was not prioritized over academic or social\ndevelopment—a balanced development in all three areas was sought.\nThe school language policy and goals were derived based on the analysis of speciﬁc\ncommunity needs [36,39,40], and the program models offered were developed based on\nresearch evidence (i.e., theory and best practices) [37,38,40,41]. The programs implemented\nat successful schools made room for ﬂexibility in implementation based on the analysis of\nstudents’ special language needs [37,38,41]. Thus, the programs and supports were tailored\naccording to the student language proﬁciency levels and development. The constant\nmonitoring of the success of multilingual students was underscored in policy and enabled\nadjustments in curriculum and practice [37,38,41].\nTable 2.

Resources\nWell-performing multilingual schools require various types of critical resources to\nmake learning effective. Loreman et al. [33] viewed resources as including ﬁnancial as\nwell as other types that are critical for education provision. As the Table 3 below suggests,\nfacilitative resource factors were identiﬁed consistently at all three levels: the macro,\nmeso, and micro levels. To begin with, successful multilingual education provision was\nconditioned by the local setting (the prevalence of L2 learners in the region) so that a\nsecond language could be used informally in addition to formal school-based use as Dixon\net al. [30] found.\nThe particular resources made available by the state or regional educational adminis-\ntrators for schools were found to matter greatly. It was critical for funding to account for\nthe nature of education provided and to set aside ﬁnancing for implementing multilingual\neducation at schools [26,35,36,39]. The educational staff was recommended to be kept\nabreast of the needs of schools, including regular professional development offered to\nteachers and administrators [26,42]. Berman et al. [26] identiﬁed the establishment of\nprofessional development networks for teachers. The availability of instructional material\nfor multilingual education provision was also underlined in the literature ([35,38].\nAt the school level, in addition to the expected factors of availability of funding [35,36,\n39] and teaching and learning materials for implementing multilingual education [35,38],\nthe availability of staff with critical competence was also stressed. First, successful imple-\nmentation of multilingual education begins with a leadership knowledgeable in multilin-\ngual education speciﬁcities.\nButtaro [42] showed how school leaders have been identiﬁed to have qualiﬁcations\nin bilingual education or in English as a Second Language. The schools reviewed in\ntheir study had leaders who also acted as instructional leaders monitoring classrooms and\nperforming oversight of the teaching and learning (see more on leadership below). Secondly,\nschools needed to have access to teachers capable of implementing multilingual education.\nAt successful schools, pedagogues were characterized by bi/multilingual abilities, the\nknowledge of linguistics and teaching and learning languages, speciﬁc preparation in\nbilingual education, and high levels of cultural awareness [4,26,30,38–42].\nAt the level of students, the review demonstrated that educational success was fa-\ncilitated by strong home literary practices, e.g., in the form of book reading or asking\nquestions [30] and also by resources, such as good native language abilities [28]; a sup-\nportive attitude, aptitude, and motivation to learn languages [28,30]; a high socioeconomic\nbackground [29,31]; and the use of the second language in student social networks [29].",

Leadership\nLoreman et al. [33] drew attention to two major aspects in the case of leadership that\nwas supportive of inclusive education: values and creating conditions for teachers to be\nable to implement inclusive education. The literature review identiﬁed several factors\nthat related to leadership values and how schools are run based on these values (see\nTable 4 below). First, several authors [35–37,40,42] underscored the true commitment of\nthe leaderships to making multilingual education work in their schools. The principals\nmust themselves be true believers in multilingual education in order to inspire and lead\nthe rest of the organization in this mission.\nThe teachers appreciate the support provided by principals, recognizing their key\nrole in making the programs a success [26,35,40]. Alanis and Rodriguez [37] showed how\nteachers gained belief in the value of multilingual programs—this was a conscious and\nplanned action by the leadership to help teachers understand the goals and philosophy\nof the program. The heads of schools were intentionally working in the name of building\n“leadership capacity among her teachers by allowing them to implement creative strategies\nin the classroom and encouraging them to take on leadership roles” [37].\nSecondly, the commitment of leaderships was often preconditioned by their compe-\ntence on the subject matter. The principals had often either obtained academic degrees in\nbilingual education [42] or had made a habit of keeping themselves abreast of most current\nresearch in the ﬁeld [37].\nThirdly, commitment and knowledge led to evidence-based management of the pro-\ngrams [35,37,40,41]. This means that using data and research was an integral part of\nrunning the programs, and the best practices were taken advantage of in favor of the\nprogram. Following the research and best practices in the ﬁeld also suggests that those",

Leaderships in outstanding\nmultilingual schools had internalized inclusive decision-making cultures so that the school\nmembers were involved in important decision-making, and therefore a basis for wide-scale\nownership of change was created.\nFinally, Robledo Montecel and Danini [40] added that strong leaders in successful\nmultilingual schools tended to stand out in their capacity to guarantee the necessary\nresources for running the schools well.\nTable 4.

Curriculum\nWhen discussing curriculum issues with inclusive education indicators, Loreman\net al. [33] emphasized the universal design for learning where the diversity of learners needs\nto be accounted for—this applies to teaching representations, means of engagement, and\nopportunities for expression. The research into the curricula of outstanding multilingual\nschools showed that similar curricula had been applied in these schools (see Table 5 for\ndetails). First, the reviewed articles demonstrated how the curricula were focused on\nincluding student home cultures and languages [4,24–26,37,40,43,44] so that the teaching\nand learning would be linguistically and culturally relevant.\nFor instance, Berman et al. [26] showed how a curriculum was set up so that, in\nlanguage arts classes, the literature selection could be based on the students’ cultural\nexperience; or how, in Science and Math, the students’ environments and real-life situations\nwere driving the focus of learning. García et al. [36] demonstrated how the curriculum\nenabled implementing translanguaging practices in teaching and learning as well as in-\ncluding personal experiences in the selection of class readings. Secondly, the reviewed\narticles demonstrated high levels of ﬂexibility in order to account for the particular needs\nof multilingual students [26,36,39–41].\nSmith et al. [41] underlined the importance of providing different types of programs\naccording to varying student needs and also emphasized the ﬂexibility of the structure\nand format of classes to meet different language proﬁciency levels. Thirdly, the research\nshowed clearly that successful multilingual programs needed to include the students’ ﬁrst\nlanguage in the curricula—not only do students need to be taught their ﬁrst language as a\nsubject, but they also need to study subjects in their ﬁrst language.\nGuglielmi [44] demonstrated how Hispanic Limited English Proﬁcient (LEP) stu-\ndents’ high-level proﬁciency in their native language (L1) predicted English reading (L2),\nwhich, in turn, was related to later academic and occupational success. In another study,\nGuglielmi [43] found a similar connection for subject learning: Hispanic students’ L1 results\npredicted their Math and Science achievements. Thomas and Collier [24,25] demonstrated\nthat minority students achieved the highest English proﬁciency and academic results in\ncases where the curriculum was set up so that L1 was taught as a subject as well as used as\na medium for learning alongside L2.",

Process Factors Contributing to Effective Multilingual Schools\n5.3.1. Climate, Attitudes, and Beliefs\nLoreman et al. suggested that the social climate consists of the beliefs and attitudes\nof all members of the educational community [33]. Then, how can the social climate be\ndescribed in successful multilingual schools? Table 6 below summarizes the ﬁndings.\nFirst, it is important to investigate how school members view cultural diversity at school—\nwhether this is appreciated or not. Many authors [26,36,40] demonstrated how cultural\nand linguistic diversity was a norm at school and was valued and seen as a resource\nrather than a problem. The same can be applied to multilingual education: in outstanding\nmultilingual schools, education in multiple languages was respected and highly appreci-\nated [26,36,37,39–41]. This value was also reﬂected in the linguistic landscapes of schools\nand respective classrooms [36,37].\nSecondly, successful multilingual schools exhibited a culture of caring [26,36,40,42].\nGarcía et al. [36] described how “Teachers, counsellors, and administrators modelled care\nas they went above and beyond the parameters of a job description. Putting in extra time,\nresources, and assistance to improve student experiences and achievement was a common\noccurrence among adults of various roles, and many saw themselves as advocates for\nstudents”. García et al. [36] identiﬁed that the care they saw permeated various aspects of\nschooling and thus called this phenomenon “transcaring”.\nThirdly, several authors underscored that the school cultures reﬂected the belief in\ncooperation and collaboration [24–26,36,40,42]. This was seen to be taking place in how\nteaching and learning was set up and practiced. It was natural how members of the schools\nwere used to working together. The cooperative spirit also extended beyond school; thus,\nthe inclusion of parents was seen as a valuable resource.\nFourthly, one critical aspect in school culture was in setting high expectations for all\nstudents regardless of their background or language skill. As was shown [26,37,40,42,45],\nit is vital to treat students with limited English equally with other students and expect high\nperformance from them—a practice unfortunately not common across all schools with\nminority students. The attitudes and beliefs described for schools were also shown to be\ncharacteristic of teachers.\nTable 6.

Practices\nAccording to Hordern [47], ”the ‘theory’ and ‘practice’ are inseparable, interwoven,\nand mutually constituted”, with practice primarily related to what educators do in their\nworkplace settings, and educational practice considered to be the normative traditions\nor certain habituated activities that are sustained over time with consensually agreed\npurposes, criteria of excellence, and practitioner mutual accountability.\nLoreman et al. [33] determined seven elements that together represent effective teach-\ning practices, which were initially found useful for the inclusion of students with special\nneeds; however, the authors claim they are the universal foundations of good instruc-\ntion that allows providing instruction according to various learner needs and learning\ncharacteristics.\nEducational practices promoting bi-/multilingualism include factors related to lan-\nguages, languages in use in school environment, the language skills of both students and\nteachers, and methods and teaching approaches in use both as a school’s common practice\nand teachers’ teaching habits (see Table 7 below). For example, one of the promoting factors\nis the use of students’ primary language (L1) in schools [26,36–38,45], and, in correlation\nwith that, effective L2 teachers are said to demonstrate sufﬁcient L2 proﬁciency, strong\ninstructional skills, and proﬁciency in their students’ L1 when engaging in school life [4,30].\nIn addition, there ought to be focus on contact between students of L1 and L2 [26], and the\nacademic development in both languages should be considered in school activities [4].\nOne distinguishing feature that connects several promoting factors is flexibility and\ncomplaisance toward linguistic differences: diverse and flexible curricular models are\ncoupled with adjusted evaluation and assessment criteria [36,40]; the teaching–learning\nof languages is different from traditional methods, including the personalization of\nlearning [5,25,36–38].\nAccording to Thomas and Collier [25], the focus of the program should be on academic\nenrichment for all students, with intellectually challenging, interdisciplinary, and discovery\nlearning. They also indicated that the program would then become positively perceived by\nthe community. The activation of students can also be detected in other indicators, such\nas involving the students in planning their own learning [26], experiential and inquiry-\nbased learning methods [26,45], or dialogical/cooperative and interaction-based learning\napproaches [26,36,37,40,42,48]. Ardasheva [28] proposed that the learner’s ability to use\ndifferent learning skills should be taught at school.\nThe elements of tolerance toward diversity as well as authenticity were also recurring\namong promoting factors, such as a culturally responsive approach to learning [4,26,36],\nthe use of authentic materials [36,38], and the attention paid to prejudice reduction [36].",

Collaboration\nLoreman et al. [33] characterized collaboration as participatory partnerships at differ-\nent levels both inside and outside schools. Evidence of collaboration processes was found\nat the region, school, and individual levels (see Table 8 below).\nAt the school level, the literature review suggested that successful multilingual schools\ninternalized the involvement of parents into school life and cooperated with them as\npartners on a regular basis. Alanis and Rodriguez [37] characterized how parents were kept\ninformed of the program and were involved in the program planning to secure continued\nsupport for the chosen model. Parental volunteering in classes was also facilitated [37].\nSuccessful bilingual schools took parental involvement seriously; some even set in place\nspecial roles, e.g., Parent Involvement Facilitators [41] or Parent Coordinators [36].\nIn addition to parents, the inclusion of the local community and other external partners\nwas a norm at well-faring multilingual schools. García et al. [36] characterized how Latino\nyouth were provided access, thanks to external partners, to various academic support\nand social development services (e.g., mental health, youth development, and college\npreparation) in order to help them out of the stigmatized English Language Learner role.\nBerman et al. [26] showed how external partners, such as various NGOs or higher education\ninstitutes, played a critical role in school reform by offering cooperation in the form of\ncoaching, decision making, curriculum revision, and teaching strategies and assessment.\nAlanis and Rodriguez [37] also underscored the important role of local universities in staff\ndevelopment and support.\nAdditionally, it mattered whether collaboration took place at school and what forms\nthis took. Writings outlined that outstanding multilingual schools tended to have inclusive\ndecision-making structures in place. Alanis and Rodriguez [37] noted how democratic\ndecision-making processes “allowed teachers and parents to have ownership of the pro-\ngram”. Similarly, García et al. [36] also observed democratic leadership styles in school\nmanagement and underscored the key role of the principal in leading by vision while\ncreating favorable conditions for teacher empowerment.\nGarcía et al. [36] identiﬁed how teacher collaboration was prioritized and supported\nat schools: teamwork had become an integral part of the school day and helped teachers",

As Robledo Montecel and Danini [40] presented: “there\nwas evidence of horizontal linkages as well, with teachers working in teams, sharing,\nexchanging, communicating, and focusing on achievement of all students”.\nButtaro [42] also identified the practice of teachers meeting and discussing vertical or\ngrade level planning issues. Berman et al. [26] experienced how team teaching was success-\nfully and flexibly carried out at the researched schools. Altogether, successful multilingual\nschools established communities of learners inside the schools to promote student success.\nTable 8.

Support\nLoreman et al. [33] viewed the category of support primarily through the individual\nlearner’s lens and referred to different types of assistance provided through in-classroom\nresources or outside the regular classroom by various educational professionals. Since this\naspect only tends to cover the school- (meso) and individual- (micro student) level factors,\nwe also extended this to include a macro view to enable a more comprehensive picture of\nthe support factors listed in the literature (see Table 9 below for details). At the macro level,\nthe identiﬁed studies discussed the importance of local government/district support in\nmore general terms as a factor contributing to success [35] and also in terms of providing\nsupport for leadership, respect for the program, and effective communication [40].\nAdditionally, the studies [26,39,42] had speciﬁc examples of state and district support\nin the format of support for teacher and administration professional training, recruitment\nhelp, providing a framework for reform (new concepts of education, school network estab-\nlishment) for schools, sponsoring and offering professional development networks and\nstipends for teachers, providing a parental involvement program, setting aside restructur-\ning grants for school innovations and speciﬁc development needs, and supporting schools’\ngoals of developing students’ bilingualism.\nAt the school level, García et al. [36] provided a detailed description of various support\nactivities that were provided to Latino students. Within schools, students were offered\nacademic and linguistic tutoring before and after classes as well as on weekends and\nsummers if necessary. García et al. also found evidence of well-established extracurricular\nprograms, targeted programs for mental health support as well as various partnerships\nwith different community organizations—all set in place to support the development of\nLatino youth academically and socially.\nAssistance services were also offered to parents with the intention of increasing their\ninvolvement. English as a Second Language classes were additionally offered to parents\nso that they could more effectively participate in information dissemination; help their\nchildren; and gain ﬁrst-hand experience of second language learning to foster greater\nunderstanding [36,37]. Berman et al. [26] identiﬁed the importance of integrated health and\nsocial services with educational services at schools; extensive parent education programs\nand after-school tutoring were found at successful schools.",

Discussion\nThis article set out to investigate which factors were associated with the effectiveness\nof multilingual education. Brisk [14] claimed that “the pieces of the educational puzzle\nexist, but they are scattered”. We made an effort here to collect and organize those pieces of\nevidence on what characterizes successful multilingual education. In the systematic litera-\nture review, we set the results into our previously developed conceptual framework [22]\n(see Figure 1).\nThe integrated theoretical framework of the effectiveness factors enabled analysis\nof multilingual education in a systematic and comprehensive way by checking to what\nextent the critical factors were in place at individual schools (see also the web tool at\nhttp://kodu.ut.ee/~kirsslau (accessed on 20 April 2021). Brisk [14] underscored the\ninterdependence of success factors and emphasized that schools often attempt to pay\nattention to several critical factors at once, although she also conceded that a step-by-step\napproach where schools follow a plan of improvement is also feasible. Loreman et al. [33]\nsuggested that school systems plan their activities backwards starting from the outcomes\nby adjusting the school practices with the end outcomes ﬁrmly in mind (the consistency of\nthe outcomes-processes-inputs).\nAt large, our review results revealed that most of the chosen studies addressed\neffectiveness factors related to the school (meso) level, while only a minority discussed\nmore general (macro) or more detailed (micro) aspects as well. This could be potentially\nexplained by the methodological choices made in the research process (see more in the\nLimitations section). At the same time, this reﬂects the nature of the studies being carried\nout and the focus of the authors reviewed.\nThat school-level studies describing effective multilingual schools almost never re-\nﬂected on the wider context of studies or the factors having relevance on the functioning of\nschools was surprising. The socioeconomic context of studies is traditionally discussed;\nhowever, the wider economic, legal, social, linguistic, etc., aspects were very rarely ad-\ndressed. The wider context is critical as this often shapes the functioning of schools\nindirectly and has relevant implications on what can be done at the school level. As\nBrisk [14] claimed, these contextual factors have critical importance in how schools judge\ntheir students and families.\nResources was one area where all the levels (macro-meso-micro) were addressed in\nthe reviewed studies: national funding principles accounted for the multilingual nature\nof education, school funding was available for implementing multilingual education, and\nresources were secured for teachers, including means for additional training. The key\nvariable appeared to be the focus on meeting individual students’ needs. The resources\nsection highlights how the language resources in the wider regional context as well as at\nthe student level could come together in a beneﬁcial way to facilitate learning at school.\nThe results of the review illuminate to a large extent what the research has underscored\nas the main processes of effective schools. Reynolds and Teddlie [7] summarized that\neffective schools were characterized by nine process factors: effective leadership, effective\nteaching, a pervasive focus on learning, a positive school culture, high expectations for all,\nstudent responsibilities and rights, progress monitoring, developing school staff skills, and\ninvolving parents.\nThe studies reviewed here conﬁrmed these ﬁndings to a large extent. We elaborated\non the meaning of these factors in a multilingual context by providing a more precise",

The reviewed studies clearly underscored how multilingual\nschools required both an understanding of the nature of multilingual learning and of how\nthe vision for the school is critical in guiding the various processes of teaching, learning,\nmanagement, inclusion, etc. The ﬁndings concur with what Carter and Chatﬁeld [11] pro-\nposed already more than three decades ago: overall, school management and multilingual\neducation effectiveness are interconnected and interdependent on each other.\nThe leadership played a critical and central role in effectiveness: expert leadership-\nbased program development on research evidence, negotiated the programs with the\ncommunity, and prioritized the competence of teaching staff to be able to implement the\nvision and programs. The focus of learning was not only tilted toward language learning\nbut also toward academic and social development, although, as Brisk [14] conceded,\nsociocultural integration was rarely measured as an outcome. In the case of school culture,\nthe true recognition of the diversity of cultures and languages was seen as a resource and\nvalue among the school members.\nStrong multilingual schools carried the enrichment ideology in their schools so that\nthe presence of students of various cultural backgrounds was not seen as a problem but\nas an opportunity. In teaching and learning, the ﬁrst language of students was promoted\nand the culture included. In the case of progress monitoring, the development of students\nwas carefully monitored and the programs were adjusted according to the needs. As seen\nfrom the review, ﬂexibility in program choice and implementation is a key to success.\nImportantly, good multilingual schools strive to complement educational services with\nsocial ones to overcome the socioeconomic disadvantage of minority students and help\nthem succeed in education. The latter is a critical aspect as it reﬂects schools’ intentional\nactivity to overcome wider social injustices [12].\nOur review also largely conﬁrmed the list of quality bilingual school factors proposed\nby previous research (see for example Baker [15], Brisk [14], or the National Research\nCouncil [13]) and is unique in adding some additional perspectives. Although Brisk dis-\ncussed various contextual and individual factors in her book, the framework for evaluation\naddressed only the variables at the school level. Other researchers [13,15] have given little\nattention to the contextual aspects when discussing effectiveness. Our review took a step\nfurther and integrated the view of the macro as well as the micro levels and discussed the\nrelevant research results.\nIn view of the macro level, our study highlights the critical aspects of national/state\npolicy and support, including securing critical resources for schools. At the micro level, we\nunderline some student-level aspects for schools to recognize and account for: the quality\nof home literary practices; native language abilities; aptitude, attitude, and motivation\nfor learning languages; social background; and the use of L2 in student social networks.\nFinally, we systematized our results into an interactive web-based application that can be\nkept up to date with recent research results and is freely available for potential users.\n7. Conclusions\nThis review brought together and synthesized the latest evidence on effective multilin-\ngual education while placing the results into a conceptual framework (see Figure 1). The\nresults have important implications in terms of two aspects. First, by outlining the conceptual\nframework as the basis of the effectiveness factors, we highlight the wide array of factors that\nthe actors and decision makers in education need to account for when addressing multilin-\ngual education issues. The framework underscores the interrelatedness of the factors at the\nindividual, school, and country/region levels as well as the different types of factors.\nSecondly, by placing the results into the conceptual framework, we offer evidence on\nwhat is currently known regarding what works in multilingual education. The consistency\nthrough all different levels of education may be the key aspect to effectiveness. Starting\nfrom the intended or expected outcomes of multilingual education, the factors shaping\neducation need to be reviewed and, if necessary, revised at the different levels while\nkeeping in mind the wider societal context.",

Regarding leadership, the aspects of\ncooperation, evidence-based management, and inclusion in decision making were promi-\nnent. Regarding the school climate and attitudes, the analyzed studies emphasized open-\nmindedness and tolerance toward diversity as well as a contemporary learner-centered\napproach to teaching and learning (dialogical, cooperative, and interaction-based methods,\nﬂexibility and adjustability according to the students’ personal needs, and a culturally\nresponsive approach to learning).\nThe overview of effectiveness factors, while placed into the conceptual framework, serves\nas useful guidance for policy makers and educational administrators dealing with languages\nin education. However, it is vital to keep in mind that the list of factors outlined here must\nbe analyzed in a specific context with the goals of education in mind. Education, and how\nit functions, is affected by a huge array of interdependent variables, and, in multilingual\neducation, the complexity is further increased by linguistic and cultural aspects [14].\nThe results of this review should be read in the context of the methodology applied,\nFirst, the choice of search terms had implications on the results. Here, the terms ‘bilingual’\nand ‘multilingual education’ were used as wider concepts of the researched phenomenon.\nHowever, in some countries or regions, other terms might be more common and, therefore,\nmight not have shown up in the search results. For instance, in the USA, especially in\ncertain regions, the term ‘dual-language education’ referring to additive bilingual programs\nhas been adopted [50].\nSecondly, the search performed in the databases tends to limit the results to mainly\njournal articles. Due to this fact, we hypothesize that ethnographic studies [10,51], although\nrather few in number [3], describing and analyzing the wider contextual factors shaping\nmultilingual education were not accessible under the current search as these are typically\npublished in a book format. Thirdly, a number of studies remained inaccessible due to\naccess restrictions.\nOverall, we propose that this overview will be useful for policy makers and educa-\ntional administrators in planning, evaluating, or revising multilingual education. Future\nstudies on multilingual effectiveness could focus further on discussing contextual (macro\nlevel) factors together with school-level factors. Our conceptual framework functions as a\nuseful guide regarding what factors need to be accounted for.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: L.K., Ü.S., Ä.L. and M.P.; methodology: L.K., Ü.S., Ä.L.\nand M.P.; formal analysis: L.K., Ü.S. and Ä.L.; investigation: L.K., Ü.S. and Ä.L.; resources: Ä.L. and\nM.P.; data curation: L.K. and Ü.S.; writing, original draft preparation: L.K. and Ü.S.; writing: L.K. and\nÜ.S.; visualization: L.K. and Ü.S.; supervision: Ä.L. and M.P.; project administration: M.P.; funding\nacquisition: M.P. and Ä.L.
