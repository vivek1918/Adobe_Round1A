For example, the \ndecision of a bank to make a loan to a business is based upon previous \nfinancial relationships with that business, the financial condition of the \ncompany as reflected by its financial statements and other factors. \n \nIf decisions are to be consistent with the intention of the decision \nmakers, the information used in the decision process must be reliable. \nUnreliable information can cause inefficient use of resources to the \ndetriment of the society and to the decision makers themselves. In the \nlending decision example, assume that the barfly makes the loan on the \nbasis of misleading financial statements and the borrower Company is \nultimately unable to repay. As a result the bank has lost both the principal \nand the interest. In addition, another company that could have used the \nfunds effectively was deprived of the money. \n \nAs society become more complex, there is an increased likelihood \nthat unreliable information will be provided to decision makers. There are \nseveral reasons for this: remoteness of information, voluminous data and \nthe existence of complex exchange transactions",

In doing this he must \nweigh the cost of obtaining more reliable information against the expected \nbenefits. \n \nA common way to obtain such reliable information is to have some \ntype of verification (audit) performed by independent persons. The \naudited information is then used in the decision making process on the \nassumption that it is reasonably complete, accurate and unbiased.  \n \n1.3      ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION  \n \nThe term audit is derived from the Latin term ‘audire,’ which \nmeans to hear. In early days an auditor used to listen to the accounts \nread over by an accountant in order to check them \n \nAuditing is as old as accounting. It was in use in all ancient \ncountries such as Mesopotamia, Greece, Egypt. Rome, U.K. and India. \nThe Vedas contain reference to accounts and auditing. Arthasashthra by \nKautilya detailed rules for accounting and auditing of public finances. \n \nThe original objective of auditing was to detect and prevent errors \nand frauds \n \nAuditing evolved and grew rapidly after the industrial revolution in \nthe 18th century With the growth of the joint stock companies the \nownership and management became separate. The shareholders who \nwere the owners needed a report from an independent expert on the \naccounts of the company managed by the board of directors who were \nthe employees. \n \nThe objective of audit shifted and audit was expected to ascertain \nwhether the accounts were true and fair rather than detection of errors \nand frauds.",

Hence the \nemphasis was not on arithmetical accuracy but on a fair representation of \nthe financial efforts \n \nThe companies Act.1913 also prescribed for the first time the \nqualification of auditors \n \nThe International Accounting Standards Committee and the \nAccounting Standard board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \nIndia have developed standard accounting and auditing practices to guide \nthe.  accountants and auditors in the day to day work \n \nThe later developments in auditing pertain to the use of computers \nin accounting and auditing. \n \nIn conclusion it can be said that auditing has come a long way \nfrom hearing of accounts to taking the help of computers to examine \ncomputerised accounts  \n \n1.4 DEFINITION \n \nThe term auditing has been defined by different authorities. \n \n1.        Spicer and Pegler: \"Auditing is such an examination of books of \naccounts and vouchers of business, as will enable the auditors to \nsatisfy himself that the balance sheet is properly drawn up, so as \nto give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business \nand that the profit and loss account gives true and fair view of the \nprofit/loss for the financial period, according to the best of \ninformation and explanation given to him and as shown by the \nbooks; and if not, in what respect he is not satisfied.\"",

Audit is a systematic and scientific examination of the books of \naccounts of a business; \n \nb. \nAudit is undertaken by an independent person or body of persons \nwho are duly qualified for the job. \n \nc  \nAudit is a verification of the results shown by the profit and loss \naccount and the state  of affairs as shown by the balance sheet. \n \nd.  \nAudit is a critical review of the system of accounting and internal \ncontrol.  \n \ne.

The auditor has to satisfy himself with the authenticity of the \nfinancial statements and report that they exhibit a true and fair view \nof the state of affairs of the concern. \n \ng  \nThe auditor has to inspect, compare, check, review, scrutinize the \nvouchers supporting the transactions and examine correspondence, \nminute books of share holders, directors, Memorandum of \nAssociation and Articles of association etc., in order to establish \ncorrectness of the books of accounts. \n \n1.6 OBJECTIVES OF AUDITING \nThere are two main objectives of auditing. The primary objective \nand the secondary or incidental objective. \n \na. Primary objective – as per Section 227 of the Companies Act \n1956, the primary duty (objective) of the auditor is to report to \nthe owners whether the balance sheet gives a true and fair view \nof the Company’s state of affairs and the profit and loss A/c \ngives a correct figure of profit of loss for the financial year. \n \nb. Secondary objective – it is also called the incidental objective \nas it is incidental to the satisfaction of the main objective. The \nincidental objective of auditing are:  \ni. \nDetection and prevention of Frauds, and  \nii. \nDetection and prevention of Errors. \n \nDetection of material frauds and errors as an incidental objective of \nindependent financial auditing flows from the main objective of \ndetermining whether or not the financial statements give a true and \nfair view. As the Statement on auditing Practices issued by the \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India states, an auditor should \nbear in mind the possibility of the existence of frauds or errors in the \naccounts under audit since they may cause the financial position to \nbe mis-stated. \nFraud refers to intentional misrepresentation of financial information \nwith the intention to deceive. Frauds can take place in the form of \nmanipulation \nof \naccounts, \nmisappropriation \nof \ncash \nand \nmisappropriation of goods. It is of great importance for the auditor \nto detect any frauds, and prevent their recurrence. Errors refer to \nunintentional mistake in the financial information arising on account \nof ignorance of accounting principles i.e. principle errors, or error \narising out of negligence of accounting staff i.e. Clerical errors.",

      "text": "7\n \n1.7 EXPRESSION OF OPINION \n \nWhen we speak of the objective, we rationalize the thinking process \nto formulate a set of attainable goals, with reference to the \ncircumstances, feasibility and constraints. In money matters, frauds \nand errors are common place of occurrence. Apart from this, the \nstatements of account have their own purpose and use of \nportraying the financial state of affairs. The objective of audit, \nnaturally, should be to see that what the statements of account \nconvey is true and not misleading and that such errors and frauds \ndo not exists as to distort what the accounts should really convey. \n \nTill recently, the principal emphasis was on arithmetical accuracy; \nadequate attention was not paid to appropriate application of \naccounting principles and disclosure, for ensuring preparation of \naccounting statement in such a way as to enable the reader of the \naccounting statement to form a correct view of the slate of affairs. \nQuite a few managements took advantage of the situation and \nmanipulated profit or loss and assets and liabilities to highlight or \nconceal affairs according to their own design. This state of affairs \ncame up for consideration in the Royal Mail Steam Packet \nCompany’s Case as a result of which the Companies Acts of \nEngland and India were amended in 1948 and 1956 respectively to \nrequire the auditor to state inter alia whether the statements of \naccount are true and fair. This is what we can take as the present \nday audit objective. The implication of the substitution of “true and \nfair” need to be understood. There has been a shift of emphasis \nfrom arithmetical accuracy to the question of reliability to the \nfinancial statements. A statement may be reliable even though \nthere are some errors or even frauds, provided they are not so big \nas to vitiate the picture. The word “correct” was somewhat \nmisplaced as the accounting largely consists of estimates. \n \nHowever, you should not infer that the detection of errors and \nfrauds is no longer an audit objective; it is indeed an audit objective \nbecause statements of account drawn up from books containing \nserious mistakes and fraudulent entries cannot be considered as a \ntrue and fair statement. To establish whether the financial \nstatement show a true and fair state of affairs, the auditors must \ncarry out a process of examination and verification and, if errors \nand frauds exist they would come to his notice in the ordinary \ncourse of checking. But detection of errors of frauds is not the \nprimary aim of audit; the primary aim is the establishment of a \ndegree of reliability of the annual statements of account. \nIf there remains a deep laid fraud in the accounts, which in the \nnormal course of examination of accounts may not come to light, it \nwill not be construed as failure of audit, provided the auditor was \nnot negligent in the carrying out his normal work. This principle was \nestablished as early as in 1896 in the leading case in Re-Kingston",

First of all, auditor’s work involve exercise of judgment, for \nexample, in deciding the extent of audit procedures and in \nassessing the reasonableness of the judgment and \nestimates made by the management in preparing the \nfinancial statements. Further much of the evidence available \nto the auditor can enable him to draw only reasonable \nconclusions there from. The audit evidence obtained by an \nauditor is generally persuasive in nature rather than \nconclusive in nature. Because of these factors, the auditor \ncan only express an opinion. Therefore, absolute certainty in \nauditing is rarely attainable. There is also likelihood that \nsome material misstatements of the financial information \nresulting from fraud or error, if either exists, may not be \ndetected. \nII. The entire audit process is generally dependent upon the \nexistence of an effective system of internal control. Further, it \nis clearly evident that there always be some risk of an \ninternal control system failing to operate as designed. No \ndoubt, internal control system also suffers from certain \ninherent limitations. Any system of internal control may be \nineffective \nagainst \nfraud \ninvolving \ncollusion \namong \nemployees or fraud committed by management. Certain \nlevels of management may be in a position to override \ncontrols; for example, by directing subordinates to records \ntransactions incorrectly or to conceal them, or by \nsuppressing information relating to transactions.

Audit report is affected  adversely if the explanation \nand information prove to be false. \n \n3. \nDependence on opinions of others:- Auditor has to rely on the views \nor opinions given by  different experts viz Lawyers, Solicitors, \nEngineers, Architects etc. he can not be an expert in all the fields",

But it is not enough to realise what an auditor should be. \nHe is concerned with the reporting on financial matters of business \nand other institutions. Financial matters inherently are to be set with \nthe problems of human fallibility; errors and frauds are frequent. \nThe qualities required, according to Dicksee, are tact, caution, \nfirmness, good temper, integrity, discretion, industry, judgment, \npatience, clear headedness and reliability. In short, all those \npersonal qualities that goes to make a good businessman \ncontribute to the making of a good auditor. In addition, he must \nhave the shine of culture for attaining a great height. He must have \nthe highest degree of integrity backed by adequate independence. \nIn fact, AAS-1 mentions integrity, objectivity and independence as \none of the basic principles. \nHe must have a thorough knowledge of the general principles of \nlaw which govern matters with which he is likely to be in intimate \ncontact. The Companies Act, 1956 and the Partnership Act, 1932 \nneed special mention but mercantile law, specially the law relating \nto contracts, is no less important. \nNeedless to say, where undertakings are governed by a special \nstatute, its knowledge will be imperative; in addition, a sound \nknowledge of the law and practice of taxation is unavoidable.",

AAS-8 on ‘Audit \nPlanning’ emphasises that an auditor should have adequate \nknowledge of the client’s business. The auditor, who holds a \nposition of trust, must have the basic human qualities apart from the \ntechnical requirement of professional training and education. \nHe is called upon constantly to critically review financial statements \nand it is obviously useless for him to attempt that task unless his \nown knowledge is that of an expert. An exhaustive knowledge of \naccounting in all its branches is the sine qua non of the practice of \nauditing. He must know thoroughly all accounting principles and \ntechniques. \nAuditing is a profession calling for wide variety of knowledge to \nwhich no one has yet set a limit; the most useful part of the \nknowledge is probably that which cannot be learnt from books \nbecause its acquisition depends on the alertness of the mind in \napplying to ever varying circumstances, the fruits of his own \nobservation and reflection; only he who is endowed with common \nsense in adequate measure can achieve it. \nLord Justice Lindley in the course of the judgment in the famous \nLondon & General Bank case had succinctly summed up the overall \nview of what an auditor should be as regards the personal qualities. \nHe said, “an auditor must be honest that is, he must not certify what \nhe does not believe to be true and must take reasonable care and \nskill before he believes that what he certifies is true”.",

For example ale to A has been recorded in B’s A/c, \nit is a posting error or it is recorded in A’s A/c but the amount is \nwrongly recorded. Similarly the balance of Rs.510 is carried forward \nas Rs.501, and then it is a casting error. Certain errors will not \naffect the trial balance for example posting in a wrong account will \nnot affect the trial balance but if there is a totalling error or a casting \nerror then the trial balance does not agree. \n \n2.3.2 Omission  \n                     In the process of recording the accounting clerk may \nomit a transaction from recording either fully or partially. If a \ntransaction is fully omitted, then it will be difficult to trace out, as \nboth the debit and the credit are missing and the trial balance will \ntally inspite of these errors.

Etc. \n \n2.6 AUDITOR’S DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN \nRESPECT OF FRAUD \n \n           The primary objective of an auditor is to express an opinion \non the financial statements. However, the auditor while conducting \nthe audit is required to consider the risk of material misstatements \nin the financial statements resulting from fraud or error. \n  \nAn audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards \ngenerally accepted in India is designed to provide reasonable \nassurance that the financial statements taken as a whole are free \nfrom material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. The \nfact that an audit is carried out may act as a deterrent, but the \nauditor is not and cannot be held responsible for the prevention of \nfraud and error. \n \nThe auditor’s opinion on the financial statements is based on the \nconcept of obtaining reasonable assurance; hence, in an audit, the \nauditor does not guarantee that material misstatements, whether \nfrom fraud or error, will be detected. Therefore, the subsequent \ndiscovery of a material misstatement pf the financial statement \nresulting from fraud or error does not, in and of itself, indicates: \na) Failure to obtain reasonable assurance, \nb) Inadequate planning, performance or judgment, \nc) Absence of professional competence and due care, or, \nd) Failure to comply with auditing standards generally accepted in \nIndia. \n \n    This is particularly the case for certain kinds of intentional \nmisstatements, since auditing procedures may be ineffective for \ndetecting an intentional misstatement that is concealed through \ncollusion between or among one or more individuals among \nmanagement. Those charged with governance, employees, or third \nparties, or involves falsified documentation. Whether the auditor \nhas performed an audit in accordance with auditing standards  \ngenerally accepted in India is determined by the adequacy of the \naudit procedures performed in the circumstances and the suitability \nof the auditor’s  reports based on the result of these procedures. \n  \nIn planning and performing his examination the auditor should take \ninto consideration the risk of material misstatements of the financial \ninformation caused by fraud or error. He should inquire with the \nmanagement as to any fraud or significant error. Which has \noccurred in the reporting period, and modify his audit procedures, if",

If circumstances indicate the possible existence of fraud \nand error, the auditor should consider the potential effect of the \nsuspected fraud and error on the financial information. If he is \nunable to obtain evidence to confirm, he should consider the \nrelevant laws and  regulations before expressing his opinion. \n \nThe auditor also has the responsibility to communicate the \nmisstatement to the appropriate level of management on a timely \nbasis and consider the need to report to it then changed with \ngovernance. He may also obtain legal advice before reporting on \nthe \nfinancial \ninformation \nor \nbefore \nwithdrawing \nfrom \nthe \nengagement. The auditor should satisfy himself  that the effect of \nfraud is properly reflected in the financial information or the error is \ncorrected in case the modified procedures performed by the auditor \nconfirm the existence of the fraud. \n \nThe auditor should also consider the implications of the frauds and \nerrors, and frame his report appropriately. In case of a significant \nfraud, the same should be disclosed in the financial statement. If \nadequate is not made, there should be a suitable disclosure in his \naudit report.  \n              \n \n2.7  BASIC PRINCIPLES OF AUDIT \n \nAAS-1 describes the basic principles, which govern the auditor's \nprofessional responsibilities and which should be complied with \nwhenever an audit is carried out. These are:- \n \n1. Integrity, objectivity and independence:  \nThe auditor should be straightforward, honest and sincere in his \napproach to his professional work. He must be fair and must not \nallow prejudice or bias to override his objectivity. He should \nmaintain an impartial attitude and appear to be free of any interest \nwhich might be regarded. Whatever it's actual effect, as being \nincompatible with integrity and objectivity. \n \n2. Confidentiality:  \nThe auditor should respect the confidentiality of information \nacquired in the course of his work and should not disclose any such \ninformation to a third party without specific authority or unless there \nis legal or professional duty to disclose. It is remarked that an \nauditor should keep his ears and eyes open but his mouth shut. \n \n3. Skill and competence:  \nThe audit should be performed and the report prepared with due \nprofessional care by persons who have adequate training, \nexperience and competence. This can be acquired through a \ncombination of general education, technical knowledge obtained \nthrough study and formal courses concluded by a qualifying",

Work performed by others: \n When the auditor delegates work to assistant* or uses work \nperformed by other auditors or experts, he will continue to be \nresponsible for forming and expressing his opinion on the financial \ninformation. At the same time he is entitled to rely on work \nperformed by others provided he exercises adequate skills and care \nand is not aware of any reason to believe that he should not have \nrelied. The auditor should carefully direct, supervise & review work \ndelegated by assistants. He should obtain reasonable assurance \nthat work performed by other auditors or experts is adequate for \nthis purpose. \n \n \n5.  Documentation:  \nThe auditor should document matters, which are important in \nproviding evidence that the audit was carried out in accordance with \nthe basic principles. \n \n \n6.  Planning: \n The auditor should plan his work to enable him to conduct an \neffective audit in an efficient and timely manner. Plans should be \nbased on knowledge of client's business. They should be further \ndeveloped and revised, if required, during the course of audit. \n \n7. Audit evidence:  \nThe auditor should obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence \nthrough the performance of compliance and substantive test \nprocedure. It will enable him to draw reasonable conclusions there \nfrom on which he has to base his opinion on the financial \ninformation. \n \n8.  Accounting system & internal control:  \nThe auditor should gain an understanding of the accounting system \nand related internal controls. He should study and evaluate the \noperation of those internal controls upon which he wishes to rely in \ndetermining the nature, timing and extent of other audit procedures. \n \n9.  Audit conclusions and reporting:  \nThe auditor should review and assess the conclusions drawn from \nthe audit evidence obtained and from his knowledge of business of \nthe entity as the basis for the expression of his opinion on the \nfinancial information.",

On this basis audits may be of two \nbroad categories i.e., audit required under law and voluntary audits. \n \n(i)  Audit required under law : The organizations which require audit \nunder law are the following: \n (a)  companies governed by the Companies Act, 1956; \n (b)  banking companies governed by the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949; \n (c)  electricity supply companies governed by the Electricity supply \nAct,  1948;              \n (d) co-operative societies registered under the co-operative \nSocieties Act, 1912; \n(e)  public and charitable trusts registered under various Religious \nand Endowment Acts; \n(f)  corporations set up under an Act of parliament or State \nLegislature such as the Life  Insurance Corporation of India. \n (g)  Specified entities under various sections of the Income-tax \nAct, 1961. \n \n(ii)    In the voluntary category are the audits of the accounts of \nproprietary entities, partnership firms, Hindu undivided families, etc. \nin respect of such accounts, there is no basic legal requirement of \naudit. Many of such enterprises as a matter of internal rules require \naudit. Some may be required to get their accounts audited on the \ndirectives of Government for various purpose like sanction of \ngrants, loans, etc. But  the important motive for getting accounts \naudited lies in the advantages that follow from an independent \nprofessional audit. This is perhaps the reason why large numbers of \nproprietary and partnership business get their accounts audited. \n \n    Government companies have some special feature which will be \nseen later. \n \nINTERIM AUDIT: \nAn audit that is taken up between two annual audits is called an \nInterim Audit. A specific date, as per the client’s requirement is \ntaken into account, e.g. 30th September, 31st December, etc. a trial \nbalance is drawn and verified with a view to prepare financial \nstatement. Financial statement are prepared and authenticated for \nthe interim audit period.  Assets and liabilities are verified for interim",

In the interim audit no \nformat is prescribed. It depends on the nature of work, coverage \nand audit observations.  \n \nCONTINUOUS AUDIT: \n   A continuous audit is one in which the auditor’s staff is engaged \ncontinuously in checking the accounts of the client, during the \nwhole year round or when for the purpose, the staff attends at quite \nfrequent intervals say weekly basis during the financial period. \n             A continuous audit is preferred for the following reasons: \ni. \nIt makes it possible for the management to exercise a stricter \ncontrol over the accounts in as much as one is able to check \nsooner the causes of any errors of frauds uncovered by such \nan audit. \nii. \nThe frequent attendance by the staff deters persons so \ninclined, from committing a fraud. \niii. \nThe accounting staff of the client is motivated to keep the books \nof account up-to-day.  \n  \n2.9  ACCOUNTING \nCONCEPT \nRELEVANT \nTO \nAUDITING  \n  \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The purpose of this standard is to establish standards on the \nconcept of   materiality and its relationship with audit risk. \n2.  The auditor should consider materiality and its relationship with \naudit    risk when conducting an audit. \n \n2.9.1 MATERIALITY:                       \n1.  Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or \nerroneous Statement) could influence the economic decisions \nof users taken on the Basis of the financial information. \nMateriality depends on the size and Nature of the item, judged \nin the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Thus, \nmateriality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than \nbeing a primary qualitative characteristic which the information \nmust have if it is to be useful. \n  \n2. The objective of an audit of financial information prepared \nwithin a  framework of recognized accounting policies and \npractices and relevant statutory requirements, if any, is to \nenable the auditor to express an opinion  on such financial \ninformation. The assessment of what is materiality of \nprofessional judgment. \n  \n3.  The concept of materiality recognizes that some matters, either \nindividually or in the aggregate, are relatively important for true \nand fair presentation of financial information in conformity at",

This process may result in different \nlevels of materiality depending on the matter being audited. \n \n4. Although the auditor ordinary establishes an acceptable \nmateriality level to detect quantitatively material misstatements, \nboth \nthe \namount \n(quantity) \nand \nnature \n(quality) \nof \nmisstatements need to be considered. An example of a \nqualitative misstatement would be the inadequate or improper \ndescription of an accounting policy when it is likely that a user \nof the financial statements would be misted by the description. \n \n5.  The auditor needs to consider the possibility of misstatements \nof relatively small amounts that, cumulatively, could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial information. For example, an \nerror in a month-end (or other periodic) procedures could be an \nindication of a potential material misstatement if that error is \nrepeated each month or each period, as the case may be. \n \n6.  Materiality should be considered by the auditor when-  \n(a) Determining the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures; \n(b) Evaluating the effect of misstatements. \n \n2.9.2 GOING CONCERN: \n \n1. The purpose of this Auditing and Assurance standard (AAS) is \nto establish standards on the auditor’s responsibilities in the \naudit of financial statements regarding the appropriateness of \nthe going concern assumption as a basis for the financial \nstatements. \n \n2. When planning and performing audit procedures  and in \nevaluating the results thereof, the auditor should consider the \nappropriateness of the going concern assumption underlying the \npreparation of the financial statements. \n \n3. The auditor’s report helps establish the credibility of the financial \nstatements. However, the auditor’s report is not a guarantee as \nto the future viability of the entity. \n \n4. An entity’s continuous as a going concern for the foreseeable \nfuture, generally a period not to exceed one year after the \nbalance sheet date, is assumed in the preparation of financial \nstatements in the absence of information to the contrary. \nAccordingly, asset and liabilities are recorded on the normal \ncourse of business. If this assumption is unjustified, the entity",

According to it, planning \nshould be continuous throughout the engagement and involves \n• \nDeveloping an overall plan for the expected scope and conduct \nof the audit; and \n• \nDeveloping an audit programme showing the nature, timing \nand extent of audit procedures. \n \nChanges in conditions or unexpected results of audit procedures \nmay cause revisions of the overall plan of and the audit \nprogramme.

In other words, an audit \nprogramme is a detailed of the accounting records of applying the audit \nprocedures in the given circumstances with instructions for the \nappropriate techniques to be adopted for accomplishing the audit \nobjectives. Businesses vary in nature, size and composition; work which \nis suitable to one business may not be suitable to be rendered by the \nauditor are the other factors that vary from assignment to assignment. \nBecause of such variations, evolving one audit programme applicable to \nall business under all circumstances is not practicable. However it \nbecomes a necessity to specify in details in the audit programme the \nnature of work to be done so that no time will be wasted on matters not \npertinent to the engagement and any special matter or any specific \nsituation can be taken care of. \nAn audit programme consists of a series of verification procedures to be \napplied to the financial statements and accounts of a given company for \nthe purpose of obtaining sufficient evidence to enable the auditor to",

Estimation Process: Test Checking and Sampling can never \n.bring complete reliability; it cannot give accurate results. It is a \nprocess of estimation. What error is tolerable for a particular matter \nunder examination is a matter of the individual's judgment in that \nparticular \n 3. Coverage of material items: Entries involving large amounts or \nrelating to material accounts are ..seen exhaustively and other entries \nare picked up for verification from the remainder according to a certain \nplan. Sometimes entries are checked for a few specified months \nexhaustively and the rest go unchecked. \n4.   Full Coverage over a time period: Test Check is normally \nplanned in such a way that the audit programmes for 3 to 5 years \ncover all types of transactions in case of a medium or large sized \nCompany. Thus, if in one year the months of January, June and \nDecember are checked; April, July and September may be checked in \nthe second year and so on. \n5.   Surprise Element: The staff and management of the Auditee \nCompany should not be able to anticipate the pattern of test checking, \notherwise they will predict the areas and periods to be covered in any \none year and will be careful regarding the same. \n6.   Flexibility: If test checking becomes routine, predictable and \nmechanical, it loses its value. Hence, the Auditor should keep \nchanging the methods of test checking at reasonably frequent intervals. \n7.   Judgment Based: The extent of test checking would primarily \ndepend on the Auditor's judgment of a particular situation.

Volume of Transactions: In case of big concerns where number of \ntransactions is quite large. \n2.   Time factor: Where the Auditor has very little time at his disposal to \ncheck all the transactions of a medium or large sized concern. \nIdentical Transactions: When there are a number of transactions of \nidentical and homogeneous nature.

Even after 100% checking, he may not derive \nabsolute satisfaction. Hence, proper and careful test checking serves \nthe audit objective in obtaining reasonable audit assurance. \nExpertise: Application of test check principles involves the application \nof mind and intelligent judgment. It enables the Auditor to use his \nexpertise effectively. \nException Principle: Test Checking adopts the principle of \nexception in control. If certain aspects of internal control do not create \nsuspicion, there is no need to verify all those transactions exhaustively. \nScientific Assessment of Risk: The Auditor assesses the risk of \nmaterial misstatements in the Financial Statements in a scientific \nmanner by drawing suitable samples and studying the same in detail. \nSaving in time: As fewer transactions are verified, time is saved to a \ngreat extent. This, in turn, enables completion of all the audits / \nverification procedures in time. \nReduction in Work: Volume of work is reduced by test checking \nmethods.

This AAS applies \nequally to both statistical sampling methods. Either method, when \nproperly applied, can provide sufficient appropriate audit evidence \n \n2. \nWhen using either statistical or non-statistical sampling \nmethods, the auditor should design and select an audit \nsample, perform audit procedures thereon, and evaluate \nsample results so as to provide sufficient appropriate audit \nevidence. \n \n3. \n“Audit sampling” means the application of audit procedures \nto less than 100% of the items within an account balance about \nsome characteristic of the items selected in order to form or assist \nin forming a conclusion concerning the population. \n \n4. \nIt is important to recognise that certain testing procedures do \nnot come within the definition of sampling. Tests performed on \n100% of the items within a population do not involve sampling. \nLikewise, applying audit procedures to all items within a population \nwhich have a particular characteristic (for example, all items over a \ncertain amount)does not qualify as audit sampling with respect to \nthe population examined, nor with regard to the population as a \nwhole, since the items were not selected from the total population \non a basis that was expected to be representative. Such items \nmight imply some characteristic of the remaining  portion of the \npopulation but would not necessarily be the basis for a valid \nconclusion about the remaining portion of the population. \n \n4.6.2 FACTORS IN DETERMINING SAMPLE SIZE- SAMPLING \nRISK \n(1)When determining the sample size, the auditor should consider \nsampling risk, the tolerable error, and the expected error. Examples \nof some factors affecting sample size are contained in Appendix 1 \nand Appendix 2. \nSAMPLING RISK \n(2) Sampling risk20 arises from the possibility that the auditor \nconclusion, based on a sample, may be different from the \nconclusion that would be reached if the entire population were \nsubjected to the same audit procedure.",

The risk of over reliance and the risk of incorrect \nacceptance affect audit effectiveness and are more likely to \nlead to an erroneous opinion on the financial statements than \neither the risk of under reliance or the risk of incorrect \nrejection. \n(5) Sample size is affected by the level of sampling risk the auditor \nis willing to accept from the results of the sample.

In substantive procedures, the tolerable error is the maximum \nmonetary error in an account balance or class of transactions that \nthe auditor would be willing to accept so that when the results of all \naudit procedures are considered, the auditor is able to conclude, \nwith reasonable assurance, that the financial statements are not \nmaterially misstated. \nExpected Error \n2. If the auditor expects error to be present in the population, a \nlarger sample than when no error is expected ordinarily needs to be \nexamined to conclude that the actual error in the population is not \ngreater than the planned tolerable error. Smaller sample sizes are \njustified when the population is expected to be error free.

While there are a number of selection methods, three methods \ncommonly used are: \n \nRandom selection, which ensures that all items in the population \nhave an equal chance of selection, for example, by use of random \nnumber tables. \n Systematic selection, which involves selecting items using a \nconstant interval between selections, the first interval having a \nrandom start. The interval might be based on a certain number of \nitems (for example, every 20th voucher number) or on monetary \ntotals (for example, every Rs 1,000 increase in the cumulative value \nof the population). When using systematic selection, the auditor \nwould need to determine that the population is not structured in \nsuch a manner that the sampling interval corresponds with a \nparticular pattern in the population. For example, if in a population \nof branch sales, a particular branch's sales occur only as every \n100th item and the sampling interval selected is 50, the result would \nbe that the auditor would have selected all, or none, of the sales of \nthat particular branch. \n*   Haphazard selection, which may be an acceptable alternative to \nrandom selection, provided the auditor attempts to draw a \nrepresentative sample from the entire population with no intention \nto either include or exclude specific units. When the auditor uses \nthis method, care needs to be taken to guard against making a \nselection that is biased, for example, towards items which are easily",

Having carried out, on each sample item, those audit \nprocedures that are appropriate to the particular audit \nobjective, the auditor should: \n(a)   analyse any errors detected in the sample; \n(b)   project the errors found in the sample to the population; \nand \n(c)   Reassess the \nsampling risk. \nAnalysis of \nErrors in the \nSample \n21. In analyzing the errors detected in the sample, the auditor will \nfirst need to determine that an item in question is in fact an error. In \ndesigning the sample, the auditor will have defined those conditions \nthat constitute an error by reference to the audit objectives. For \nexample, in a substantive procedure relating to the recording of \naccounts receivable, a mis-posting between customer accounts \ndoes not affect the total accounts receivable. Therefore, it may be \nappropriate to consider this an error in evaluating the sample \nresults of this particular procedure, even though it may have an \neffect on other areas of the audit such as the assessment of \ndoubtful accounts. \n12. When the expected audit evidence regarding a specific sample \nitem cannot be obtained, he auditor may be able to obtain sufficient \nappropriate \naudit \nevidence \nthrough \nperforming \nAlternative \nprocedures. For example, if a positive account receivable \nconfirmation has been equated and no reply was received, the \nauditor may be able to obtain sufficient appropriate suit evidence \nthat the receivable is valid by reviewing subsequent payments from \nthe ;customer. If the auditor does not, or is unable to, perform \nsatisfactory alternative procedures, )r if the procedures performed \ndo not enable the auditor to obtain sufficient appropriate audit \nevidence, the item would be treated as an error. \n>3. The auditor would also consider the qualitative aspects of the \nerrors. These include the nature and cause of the error and the \npossible effect of the error on other phases of the audit. \n24. In analysing the errors discovered, the auditor may observe that \nmany have a common eature, for example, type of transaction, \nlocation, product line, or period of time. In such circumstances, the \nauditor may decide to identify all items in the population which \npossess the common feature, thereby producing a sub-population, \nand extend audit procedures in this area. The auditor would then \nperform a separate analysis based on the items examined for 3ach",

There are several \nacceptable methods of projecting error results. However, in all the \ncases, the method of projection will need to be consistent with the \nmethod jsed to select the sampling unit. When projecting error \nresults, the auditor needs to keep in mind the qualitative aspects of \nthe errors found. When the population has been divided into sub-\npopulation, the projection of errors is done separately for each sub-\npopulation and the results are combined. \nReassessing Sampling Risk \n26. The auditor needs to consider whether errors in the population \nmight exceed the tolerable error. To accomplish this, the auditor \ncompares the projected population error to the tolerable error taking \ninto account the results of other audit procedures relevant to the \nspecific control or financial statement assertion. The projected \npopulation error used for this comparison in the case of substantive \nprocedures is net of adjustments made by the entity. When the \nprojected error exceeds tolerable error, the auditor reassesses the \nsampling risk and if that risk is unacceptable, would consider \nextending the audit procedure or performing alternative audit \nprocedures. \n",

It assists the \nmanagement in the performance of its various functions. It means the built \nin cross-checks in the system supplemented with proper supervision and \ninternal audit carried out by the staff appointed by the organisation These \ndays business has been become more complex both in nature and size \nand the management finds it difficult to get correct information about the \nvarious aspects of the business. Internal control assures the management \nthat the information supplied to it is reliable and accurate. The Internal \ncontrols are exercised to ensure the accuracy and the reliability of \naccounting data and other records, to identify weaker areas of operation \nand to improve them to increase operational efficiency of the business, to \nsafeguard its assets and to ensure orderly conduct of business. \n \nThe American Institute of Public Accountants has defined internal \ncontrol as the plan of organisation and all the co-ordinate methods, and \nmeasures adopted within a business to safeguards its assets, check the \naccuracy and the reliability of its accounting data, promote operational \nefficiency and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies. A \nsystem of internal control extends beyond those matters which relate \ndirectly to the function of the accounting and financial departments. \n \nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales \ndefines internal control as \"internal control means not only internal check \nor internal audit, but the whole system of control financial and otherwise, \nestablished by management in order to carry on the business of the \ncompany in an orderly manner, safeguard its assets and secure as far as \npossible accuracy and reliability of its records\".",

The formalization of the concept of internal \ncontrol in the sphere of business administration is a comparatively recent \nphenomenon.  \n \n                 In the sphere of a business, control is an accepted device for \noptimum utilization of the resources and opportunities for maximisation of \nprofits. All operations of a business are carried on with the help of human \nagents and equipment; both these factors need supervision so that the",

A small \ntrader having a grocery shop hardly needs more than one or two \nassistants. He decides work to be done by the assistants. He always \nknows his own stock, cash and bank position. He has the knowledge of \ndaily sales. He himself knows the sources for purchases. He keeps the \nrecord of the debtors and creditors. The assistants merely help him in \ndelivering doors to customers or to arrange the goods in proper order. \n \n               From the above, it can be observed that control is entirely \ncentralized with the owner and there is no significant delegation of duties. \nHowever, as the business grows in size it soon reaches a stage where the \nowner can no longer keep himself intimately informed about the detailed \noperations of his business, activities of the employee and their discharge \nof their responsibilities. To cope with the increasing size and volume of \nbusiness, he has to employ more and more people and for systematically \ncarrying on the business, he has to specify the tasks for each person. For \nremote operations he has also to rely upon these people, for carrying out \nthe work, for the custody of the materials, documents and equipments \nentrusted to them. He has also to ensure that the equipment and facilities \nare properly maintained. For this purpose, he has to give shape to a form \nof organization from which he would be in a position to know the board \ndetails of the work involved and the persons responsible for such work. \nAlso, he has to work out a plan of delegation of duties and authority for \nthe simple reason that, for anything and everything. People need not \ncome to him for advice or decision, because, under such circumstances, \nhe would not be able to find time to apply his mind to matters of more \nimportance. \n \nHuman behavior is such that if it is not under some sort of regulation or \ncontrol, it often tends to depart from the proper path. It needs to be kept \nunder systematic watch not only for ensuring that the employee does he \nwork, but also to see that he does it in the manner laid down for the \npurpose and handles the materials and equipments with proper care.",

To acquaint himself \nabout how all the accounting information is collected and processed and \nto learn the nature of controls that makes the information reliable and \nprotect the company’s assets, calls for considerable skill and knowledge. \nIn many cases, very little of this information is available in writing; the \nauditor must ask the right people the right questions if he is to get the \ninformation he wants. It would be better if he makes written notes of the \nrelevant information and procedures contained in the manual or \nascertained on enquiry. \n \nTo facilitate the accumulative of the information necessary for the proper \nreview  and evaluation of internal controls, the auditor can use one of the \nfollowing to help him to know and assimilate the system and evaluate the \nsame: \n(1) Narrative record;  \n(2) Check list;  \n(3) Questionnaire; and \n(4) Flow chart; \n  \n (1) The narrative record is a complete and exhaustive description of the \nsystem as found in operation by the auditor. Actual testing and \nobservation are necessary before such a system is in operation and \nwould be more suitaed to small business. The basic disadvantages of \nnarrative records are: \n \n1. To comprehend the system is operation is quit difficult. \n2. To identify weaknesses or gaps in the system \n3. To incorporate charges arising on account of reshuffling of manpower, \netc.",

This is, however, quite wrong, for \nvouching comprises such an examination of the ledger entries as will \nsatisfy the auditor, not only that the entry is supported by the \ndocumentary evidence but it has been properly made upon the books of \naccounts.\"  \n \nFrom the above it becomes clear that vouching means testing the \ntruth of entries appearing in the primary books of accounts. In short, \nvouching means to examine the evidence in support of any transaction or \nentry recorded in the books of accounts. Vouching does not merely see \nthat the entries and transactions are supported by proper documentary \nevidence. The auditor should be satisfied that they are properly \nmaintained, they are supported by all evidence and they are correctly \nrecorded in the books of accounts.  \n \nVoucher \n \nAny documentary evidence supporting the entries in the records is \ntermed as a voucher. Any document, which supports the entries in the \nbooks of accounts and establishes the arithmetical accuracy, is called a \nvoucher. \n \nExamples of vouchers:  \n \nA bill, a receipt, an invoice, goods received note, salaries and \nwages sheets, goods inward and outward register, stores records, \ncounterfoil of a cheque book, counterfoil of pay-in-slip book, bank \nstatement, bank pass book, delivery challans, agreements, a material \nrequisition slip, copy of purchase order, minute book, rnemorandum and \narticles of association, partnership deed, trust deed, prospectus etc. are \nthe examples of vouchers.",

In auditing the \naccounts of a business, every single copy is not usually checked by the \nauditor; what is usually done in practice is that a representative number of \nentries of each class are selected and checked and if they are found \ncorrect, the remaining entries are taken to be correct. This is known as \nTest Checking. In those organizations, where satisfactory internal check \nsystem is in existence, the auditor need not carry out detailed checking. \nHe may adopt Test checking. It is a system of sampling employed by the \nauditor for the purpose of reducing the volume of detail checking involved \nin the audit. If, in Test Checking, he finds that the records checked by him \nare correct then no further detail checking need be carried out.  \n \nTest Checking v/s Statistical Sampling \n \nSelection of items for the purpose of checking can be done in two \nways: (i) Judgment (ii) Statistical Sampling. \n \nWhen the judgment method is applied, the method of checking is \ncalled test checking. When sampling techniques are applied it is called \nstatistical sampling.  \n \nPrecautions To Be Taken - While adopting the test check, the auditor \nmust take the following precautions:  \n \n1. \nEntries selected for test checking must be representative of all \ntransactions.  \n \n2. \nThe selection of the items should be at random.",

Caution must also be \ntaken to see that the test checking may not become insignificant in extent \nor automatic and unrepresentative.

Firstly the colour of the tick should be determined so that it is \nunique and will not be confused with that of the client's staff or internal \nauditors. Secondly the types of ticks to be used should be selected. The \nticks should be placed at the right places so that the matter remains  \nlegible and the records do not become shabby.  \n \nCare should be taken to see, that the use of different ticks does \nnot become known to the clients staff.  \n \n6.4  AUDITING IN DEPTH \n \nTaylor and Perry have defined Auditing in Depth as : “the \nexamination of the system applied within a business entailing the tracing \nof certain transactions from their origin to their conclusion, investigating at \neach stage the records created and their authorization”. \n \nAudit in depth does not mean 100% checking. It is a detailed \nexamination of the selected transactions from the beginning to the end. \nThus, it is used along with test checking. For example, if the auditor has \ndecided to check 25% of purchase transactions, these transactions \nshould be checked in depth.

MEANING OF VERIFICATION : \n \nSpicer and Pegler have defined verification as “it implies an inquiry into \nthe value, ownership and title, existence and possession and the \npresence of any charge on the assets”. Verification is a process by which \nan auditor satisfies himself about the accuracy of the assets and liabilities \nappearing in the Balance Sheet by inspection of the documentary \nevidence available. Verification means proving the truth, or confirmation of \nthe assets and liabilities appearing in the Balance Sheet. \n \nThus, verification includes verifying :- \n \n1. \nThe existence of the assets  \n2. \nLegal ownership and possession of the assets \n3. \nAscertaining that the asset is free from any charge, and  \n4. \nCorrect valuation  \n \nOf course it is not possible for the auditor to verify each and every asset. \nIt was held in  Kingston Cotton Mills case that “it is not part of an auditor’s \nduty to take stock. No one contend that it is. He must rely on other people \nfor the details of stock in trade in hand”. \n \nHowever, as per the decision given in Mc Kesson and Robins case (1939) \nthe auditor must physically inspect some of the assets. Now the auditor \nhas to report whether the balance sheet shows true and fair view of the \nstate of affairs of the company. Hence, he is required to verify all the \nassets and liabilities appearing in the balance sheet. In case of failure, the \nauditor can be held liable for damages.  \n \nAccording to the `statement of auditing practices’ issued by ICAI, “the \nauditor’s object in regard to assets generally is to satisfy that :- \n \n1. \nThey exist.  \n2. \nThey belong to the client.  \n3. \nThey are in the possession of the client or the persons authorized by \nhim.",

Vouching \ngoes to prove the arithmetical accuracy and the genuineness of the \ntransactions, whereas verification goes to enquire into the value, \nownership, existence and possession of assets and also to confirm \nwhether they are free from any mortgage or charge. The fact of the \npresence of any entry regarding the acquisition of asset does not prove \nthat the particular asset actually exists on the Balance Sheet date, rather \nit purports to prove that the asset ought to exist; on the other hand, \nverification through physical examination and confirmation proves whether \na particular asset actually exists without having any charge on the date of \nthe balance Sheet.",

An auditor should put all his \nendeavor to satisfy himself whether a particular  asset is shown in the \nBalance Sheet at proper value, whether the concern holds the title to the  \nasset and the asset is in the sole possession of the concern and lastly \nwhether the asset is free  from any charge. If the auditor fails to perform \nhis duty, he will be held liable. In case of London Oil Storage Co. Ltd. Vs. \nSear Hasluck & Co. (1904) Chief Justice Alverstone remarked : `It is the \nduty of the auditor to verify the existence of the assets stated in the \nBalance sheet and he will be liable for any damage suffered by the client \nif he fails in his duty.  \n \nBesides the legal importance, verification also plays an important \nrole to guard against improper valuation of assets like stock-in-trade \nwhich may inflate or deflate the profit position of the concern. Improper \nvaluation of assets may also conceal the actual position of the business \nas reflected in the Balance Sheet.  \n \nHowever, it is not possible on the part of the auditor to physically \nverify each and every asset because time may not permit him to do so, or \nhe may not have sufficient technical knowledge of the assets concerned. \nIt was decided in the case of “Kingston Cotton Mills: that it is not a part of \nan auditor’s duty to take stock. No one contends that it is. He must rely on \nother people for the details of the stock-in-trade.  \n \nAgain, while going through the decision of Mc Kesson and Robins case in \n1939, we find that the auditor should physically verify some of the assets. \nIf possible, title documents like negotiable instruments, shares, \ndebentures, securities, etc. are to be thoroughly examined on the last day \nof the accounting period. He should satisfy himself that the transactions, if",

The auditor is also \nsupposed to verify stock-in-trade with reference to the purchase book, the \nstock records, the gatekeeper’s book, etc. though law does not specially \ncompel him to take stock-in-trade. \n \n7.8  VALUATION OF ASSETS  \n \n(i) \nMeaning :  \n \n \nValuation of assets means determining the fair value of the assets \nshown in the Balance Sheet on the basis of generally accepted \naccounting principles.

The auditor is required to verify whether the value ascertained \nis fair one or not. For this, he may rely on the technical certificate issued \nby the experts in the field.  \n \n \nValuation of assets means not only checking value of the assets \nowned by an  organization as on Balance Sheet date, but also critical \nexamination of the value of these assets  \n(comparative analysis of different assets). \n \n \nThe auditor has also to see that the principle of valuation of assets \nis consistently adopted and is based on established principles of \naccountancy. For the purpose of convenience, those assets are classified \nas under to determine their value.  \n \n1. \nFixed Assets  \n2. \nCurrent Assets or Floating Assets \n3. \nWasting Assets \n4. \nIntangible Assets \n5. \nFictitious Assets.",

      "text": "141\n1. \nFixed Assets : Fixed Assets are usually valued at `going concern \nvalue’ which means cost less depreciation. Cost here means \npurchase price of the assets plus all incidental manufacturing, \nbuying and installation expenses incurred to bring the assets in \nuse. Depreciation is the provision made for the reduction in the \nvalue of the assets on account of their usage, natural wear and \ntear and obsolescence etc. The depreciation provided should be \nfair, otherwise the value of fixed assets may not be fair. What is a \nfixed asset depends on the nature of the business organization. \n \n2. \nCurrent Assets or Floating Assets : These are usually \nconverted into cash at the earliest opportunity in the process of \nbusiness activity, e.g. stocks, bills receivables, sundry debtors, \netc. Based on conservatism principle, usually current asset are \nvalued at original value (cost price) or market value (realizable \nvalue) whichever is lower. Because they are intended to be \nconverted into cash at the earliest possible time, hence what value \nwe may realize is important. This method is adopted to strengthen \nthe financial position of a concern by indirectly providing for \nexpected loss by way of fall in the market value of the assets. This \nprinciple is held by the conservatism convention of accounting, i.e. \ndo not expect profits but provide for anticipated losses. \n \n3. \nWasting Assets : Wasting Assets means those which lose their \nvalue gradually upon their use, e.g. a mine, a quarry etc. To value \nthese assets firstly we should determine the usefulness of the \nassets in terms of units of production etc. and as per their actual \nuse the value is to be reduced on proportionate basis. If in a \nparticular period this type of asset is not used then the value may \nnot diminish also. Thus, these assets are to be reduced on the \nbasis of consumption. But sometimes it may be difficult to adopt \nthis method, then the `cost less depreciation’ principle may have to \nbe applied.  \n \n4. \nIntangible Assets : Usually intangible assets like goodwill, patent \nrights, know how, etc. are valued on cost basis. But if the same \nare acquired by a non-cash transaction, then the fair market value \nis to be taken as the value of intangible assets. Auditor should also \nsee the period of time and till it is fully written off, they are shown \nas assets because they do not have any realizable value. They \nare to be valued at actual cost less amount written off as \ndepreciation upto Balance Sheet date.",

They are to be valued at actual cost less \namount written off upto the Balance Sheet date.  \n \n7. 8.1 Methods of Valuation  \n \n \nThe following are the various principles of valuation of assets  \n \n(1) \nCost Price (Going Concern Value ) : Under this method actual \ncost of assets are reduced by the depreciation provided. Usually \nthis method is applied to value fixed assets.  \n \n(2) \nMarket Value : This refers to the market value of the asset i.e. the \nprice at which the asset is being transacted in the market. This is \napplied to value the current assets only when this is lower than \ncost of the asset. Usually market value is adopted to value items \nhaving perishable nature. \n \n(3) \nScrap Value : Assets which are useless for the enterprise may be \nsold as scrap in the market. The value for which such assets can \nbe disposed of as scrap, is called as scrap value of assets.  \n \n(4) \nReplacement Value : This represents the value at which the \nexisting assets can be replaced. That means the price to be paid \nto acquire such type of assets in the market on the date of the \nbalance Sheet.  \n \n(5) \nRealisable Value : The value that can be obtained if the asset is \nsold in the market i.e. anticipated selling price.

It has \nalready been pointed out that the auditor is not supposed to have \ntechnical knowledge regarding the valuation of assets. Therefore, he has \nto depend upon the valuation made by the directors, expererts, surveyors, \netc, to a great extent. But does it relieve him from liability if certain assets \nare overvalued or undervalued by the directors, experts or surveyors etc? \nThe reply is definitely no, because the auditor cannot give a guarantee for \nabsolute correctness or the state of affairs when he has to depend upon \nothers, and also where assets are valued according to the estimated \ndepreciation. He has to see that the management tries to show the fairest \npossible estimate of the position of the state of affairs of the concern. \nUnder these circumstances, the auditor should see that assets are valued \naccording to certain accepted principles of accountancy. He should check \nthe estimation in a reasonable manner. The auditor in any case should \nthoroughly examine the available papers and documents to arrive at the \ncorrect value of assets. In case of a little suspicion as regards the \nvaluation of assets he should probe into the matter. \n \n7.8.3  Distinction between verification and valuation : \n \n1. \nMeaning : verification establishes existence, ownership and \nacquisition of assets whereas valuation certifies correctness of the \nvalue of assets and liabilities.  \n \n2. \nTime : Verification is done at the end of the year whereas \nvaluation is done during the year.  \n \n3. \nPersonnel : Verification is done by auditor whereas valuation is \ndone by the proprietor himself.  \n \n5. \nEvidence : The title deeds, receipts of payments constitute \ndocumentary evidence for verification where as certificate given by \nthe proprietor is the documentary evidence for valuation.",

Verifying such value of assets is an \nimportant part of the auditor’s duties. As the assets are belonging to the \nproprietors, it is their basic duty to see that the value of assets is properly \ndetermined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles. \nWhat the auditor is required to do is satisfy himself that all the assets are \nshown at their “full and fair value”. Auditor need not himself value the \nassets. But he has just to see whether the value that have been placed \nare true, correct and fair. As such he has to apply his skill, intelligence \nand tactfulness to confirm the values of the assets as indicated. Usually \nassets are valued by specially qualified persons like valuers and \nsurveyors. Hence he can rely on the certificate issued by those \nprofessionals, but must disclose the fact of this in his report. An auditor is \nnot supposed to have special technical knowledge in respect of valuation \nof assets. But he should always try to examine the value of assets himself \nwith the help of supporting evidence available with the company. He has \nalso to depend many a times upon the valuation made by the directors, \npartners and proprietors  of the organization.  \n \nTherefore, we say that “An auditor is intimately connected with \nvalues”. Because, it is the duly of the auditor to decide the value of the \nasset himself only he has to see whether the value decided upon is \ncorrect, fair and true. Because, if the assets are not properly valued, \nBalance Sheet will not give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of a \nconcern. Though auditor is not a valuer he is liable for improper valuation \nof assets if the same is not verified by himself i.e. negligence in the \nverification of the value of assets makes an auditor liable for negligence. \nHence, whenever he feels that the value of any asset as disclosed is not \nproper or fair he should mention the fact in his report and disown the \nresponsibility. Mere informing the directors or proprietors regarding \nirregularity does not absolve him from his liabilities. Though the auditor is \nnot the guarantor of the value of asset, he has to be careful while \ncertifying the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account, because third \nparties place their reliance on the audited Balance sheet to take their",

If he checks the value of the \nassets intelligently and with utmost care he cannot be held liable for \nnegligence.  \n \n \nAs the auditor is liable to an unlimited extent for indeterminate \nperiod of time to an indefinite class of people, he has to be very careful \nwhile accepting the valuation of assets. Hence, he is not a valuer, but \nsurely connected with values intimately.  \n \n7.11. VERIFICATION OF LIABILITIES : \n \n \nMeaning : The verification of liabilities implies an enquiry into the \nnature, extent and existence of liabilities.  \n \n \nIt involves ensuring the following:  \n \n1. \nThat all the liabilities have been clearly stated on the liability side of \nthe Balance Sheet.  \n \n2. \nThat all the liabilities reiate to the business itself.  \n \n3. \nThat they are correct and authorized.  \n \n4. \nThat they are shown in the Balance sheet at their actual figures.  \n \n \nIt is an important duty of an auditor to verify the liabilities \nappearing in the Balance Sheet of the company. The object of verification \nof liabilities is to ascertain whether there is any improper inflation or \ndeflation of values or improper creation of an imaginary liability in the \nbooks. This form of manipulation is done in most cases to inflate or \ndeflate the profits of the concern and thus make the position of the \nbusiness appear stronger than what actually is, to create a secret reserve. \nAs a result of such manipulation, the Profit and Loss Account and the \nBalance Sheet prove to be incorrect and thus the Balance Sheet does not",

The auditor should \nexamine the Director’s Minute Book, correspondence made with \nthe legal advisers and the information obtained from the officials of \nthe business. He has to ensure that proper provision has been \nmade for all such liabilities and if he is not satisfied, he should \nmention the fact in his report.

But it cannot be ascertained accurately \nbecause the final liability on this account can be known only when \nthe assessment is completed. Therefore, a fair estimate for \nproviding this liability is necessary. Hence, the auditor has to \nverifty the calculation done to arrive at the provision expected to \nbe made.  \n2. \nHowever, when finally the assessment is over, the auditor should \nsee that the excess or short provision is properly adjusted in the \nbooks.  \n \n3. \nWhere any appeal is pending and the liability challenged, the \nsame is a contingent liability.

The extent of such examination would depend on the \nauditor's evaluation of the efficacy of internal controls. \n(it) The auditor should check the agreement of balances as shown in the \nschedules of debtors with those in the ledger accounts. He should \nalso check the agreement of the total of debtor balances with related \ncontrol account.

Similar considerations \napply in respect of claims for export incentives, claims for price \nescalation in case of construction contracts, claims for interest on \ndelayed payments, etc. \n(vz'z'z) The auditor should examine whether contingent liability, if any, in \nrespect of bills accepted by customers and discounted with the \nbanks is properly disclosed. He should also examine whether \nadequate provision on this account has been made, where required. \nDirect Confirmation Procedure \n (z)  The verification of balances by direct communication with debtors is \ntheoretically the best method of ascertaining whether the balances \nare genuine, accurately stated and undisputed, particularly where \nthe internal control system is weak. The utility of this procedure \ndepends to a large extent on receiving adequate response to \nconfirmation requests.

In other concerns, the \ncost of tools, dies, etc. purchased is debited to appropriate assets \naccount, and an inventory of the unused items at the end of the year is \nprepared and valued; the sum total of opening balance and purchase \nreduced by the value of closing stock, as disclosed by the inventory, is \ncharged off to Production Account in respect of such assets. On the \nother hand, some concerns carry such assets at their book values at the \nend of the first year and charge off the cost of all the purchases in the \nsubsequent year to the Production Account on the plea that they \nrepresent cost of replacement. \n \nThe most satisfactory method, however, is that of preparing an inventory \nof serviceable articles, at the close of each year, and revaluing the assets \non this basis, the various articles included in the inventory being valued at \ncost.

According to it \"a \ncontingency is a condition or situation, the ultimate outcome of which, \ngain or loss, will be known or determined only on the occurrence or non-\noccurrence, of one or more uncertain future events.\" The regard has to \nbe to conditions or situation at the balance sheet date , the financial effect \nof which is to be determined by future events which may or may not \noccur. \nThe definition clearly envisages that either there may be contingent \nlosses or contingent gains. As a matter of prudence, contingent gains \nneed not be accounted for in financial statements since this may result in \nthe recognition of revenue which may never be realised. Therefore, we \nhave to consider contingent loss for which corresponding liability should \nbe accounted for in financial statements. Before discussing the \naccounting treatment of contingent losses, let us understand contingent \nliabilities in clear terms. \n \nA contingent liability is a possible liability of a presently determinable \namount or one indeterminable which has arisen from past dealings or \nactions that may not become a legal obligation in the future. The \nuncertainty as to whether there will be any legal obligation distinguishes a \ncontingent liability from an actual liability. An obligation may be a \ncontingent liability when the very basis of the obligation is contested. For \nexample, when a claim is made against a company in respect of \ninfringement of a patent and the companv does not possess a legitimate \ndefence, the liability, though the amount of it is uncertain would be an \nactual liability, but if the claim is untenable in law, the liability would only \nbe a contingent liability. Though both of them in actual practice are \ndescribed somewhat loosely as contingent liabilities, their natures are \ndifferent. In one case, the liability is admitted but its amount is uncertain \nwhile in the other, the very basis of the obligation is denied. There is \nanother type of contingent liability, as in the case of partly paid shares, or \nin respect of contract for capital expenditure wherein there is an \nobligation to pay a certain sum of money upon which there will be \nacquisition of an asset of corresponding value. Contingent liabilities also \narise when some of the Bills Receivable as discounted or when \nguarantees are given for loans granted to the third parties. \n \nFrom the auditing point of view, different types of contingent liabilities are \ndivided into two broad categories, one in respect of which a provision has \nbeen made and the other for which there is no provision. AS 4 provides \nguidance in respect of circumstances when provision has to be made for",

Until the 18th century, cost accounting was in the \ndomain of the engineer. Its integration with financial accounting began \nwhen accountants started to audit the cost records. Under the influence of \nfinancial accountant, cost accounting came to be viewed almost \nexclusively as a means of inventory valuation and profit measurement. It \nhas grown only in the 20th century as an independent discipline. \n \n \nCost accounting has found to be of assistance to management, in \ncompiling and providing requisite statistical data. It has developed rapidly \nand assisted management in providing valuable information to take \nappropriate decision in time. Cost Accounting throws light on the \nexcessive waste of materials, inefficient labour operations, idle machinery \nand many other similar factors, which are responsible for reduction in the \nprofit of the business activities. Managements found that cost accounting \ncould render valuable assistance in planning, controlling and coordinating \nthe activities.",

It helps management in different \nfields one of such fields is presentation of information in the most useful \nmanner. Cost Accounting is used to measure, analyse or estimate the \ncosts. Profitability and Performance of individual products, departments \nand other segments of an organization, for either internal or external or \nboth and to report to the interested parties. Cost Accounting concerns \nitself with the synthesis and analysis of costs. Its purpose in the modern \ndays is to help management in the twin functions of decision- making and \ncontrol. Thus, Cost Accounting is not simply cost finding but it is advising \nmanagement, planning and control of organization and business \noperations. The Companies Act, also provides that certain companies \nhave to maintain cost accounting records and accounts and conduct the \naudit of cost accounts. \n \n \n \n \n \n9.7 \nADVANTAGES OF COST ACCOUNTING  \n \n \nA cost accounting system when installed will result in the \nfollowing:- \n \ni) \nCost Accounting  reveals areas where materials were used \nexcessively, labour operated inefficiently and expenses incurred   \nexorbitantly. \n \nii) \nIt suggests cost reduction programme.

Cost Accounting has the \nobjectives of determining Product costs, facilitate planning and control of \nregular business activities and supply information for taking short term and \nlong-term decisions. Cost Accounting is useful in different areas such as \nmaterials, labour, overheads, stock valuation etc. \n \nFinancial Accounting is concerned with providing information to \nexternal users. It does not provide detailed cost information for different \njobs, processes or departments. It also does not possess an adequate \nsystem of standards to evaluate the Performance of departments and \nemployees. There are two major methods of costing- job costing and \nprocess costing. Job costing includes Contract, Batch and Multiple costing. \nCosting system should be developed in an organisation to fit in the general \norganisation of the business.

For the purpose,  it employs labour and provides other facilities. \nWhile compiling production cost, amounts spent on all these facilities are \nrequired to be ascertained. Thus, cost ascertainment involves (a) \ncollection and classification of costs according to cost elements (b) its \nallocation or apportionment to cost centres or units (c) choice of an \nappropriate method of costing and (d) selection  of an appropriate costing \ntechnique. Costs are primarily classified into various elements for \naccounting and control.      \n \n10.2 CONCEPT OF COST \n \nCost represents a sacrifice, a foregoing or a release of something \nof value. It is reckoned in money and usually appears as payment of \nmoney. It is money outlay for productive factors. \n \nCosts are expenditure incurred in doing something. Costing is the \nprocess of determining the cost of doing something i.e cost of \nmanufacturing an article, rendering service or performing a function. \n \nCost is composed of three elements- material, labour and \nexpenses or overheads. Each of these costs can be further classified as \n(a) Direct and (b) Indirect. \n \nDirect costs are costs which can be easily identified with a \nparticular Product, Process or Department. Indirect costs refers to costs \nwhich cannot be conveniently identified with a particular product. Process \nor Department. Indirect costs are common costs like rent, repairs salaries, \nwhich are incurred for the benefit of a number of cost units or cost \ncentres.",

There are many \nobjectives of cost classifications depending on the requirements of \nmanagement. The different cost classifications are as follows:- \n \n10.3.1 Cost Classification by Elements  : \n \nThe constituent elements of costs are broadly classified into three \ndistinct elements i.e. materials, labour and expenses These three \nelements of cost can be further grouped into direct and indirect \ncategories. Direct materials refer to the cost of materials which are \nconveniently and economically traceable to specific units of output for \nexample. Raw cotton in textiles, crude oil in making diesel. The indirect \nmaterials refer to materials that are needed for the completion of the \nproduct but whose consumption with regard to the product is either so \nsmall or so complex that it would not be appropriate to treat it as a direct \nmaterial. For example, stationery lubricants, cotton waste etc. \n \n10.3.2 Cost Classification by Function. \n \nA business organisation has to perform several functions such as \nManufacturing, Administration, Selling and Distributing and Research and \nDevelopment. Functional classification of cost implies that the business \nperforms many functions for which  costs are incurred. Expenses or Costs \nare usually classified by function and grouped under the headings of \nManufacturing, Selling and Administrative costs in measuring net income. \n \nManufacturing costs are all check costs incurred to manufacture \nthe products and to bring them to a saleable condition. This includes \ndirect material, direct labour and indirect manufacturing costs or \noverheads. Administration costs are incurred for formulation of policy, \ndirecting the organisation and controlling the activities excluding the cost \nof research, development, production, selling and distribution. These \ncosts include  salary of executives, office, staff, office rent, stationery, \npostage etc. Selling costs, include the cost of creating and stimulating \ndemand and getting customers. For example, advertisement, salary and",

Distribution costs include the cost of \nwarehouse, freight, cartage etc. \n \nResearch and Development costs are incurred in the process of \nfinding out new ideas, new processes by experiments or other means of \nputting the results of such experiments on a commercial basis. Functional \nclassification of cost is important because it provides an opportunity to the \nmanagement to evaluate the efficiency of departments performing \ndifferent functions in an organisation. \n \n10.3.2 Cost Classification by variability: \n \nCost can be classified as (i) fixed (ii) variable and (iii) semi -fixed \nor semi variable in terms of their variability or changes in cost behaviour \nin relation to changes in output or activity or volume of production. Activity \nmay be indicated in any form such as units of output, hours worked, \nsales, etc. The separation of costs into variable and fixed categories is \nthe most difficult part of the costing operation. Certain costs are easily \nidentifiable as variable or fixed while other costs can be segregated only \nafter careful consideration of their nature and an examination of their \nbehaviour. \n \ni) \nFixed costs: \n \nFixed cost is a cost which does not change in total for a given time \nperiod despite wide fluctuations in output or volume of activity. These \ncosts must be met by the organisation irrespective of the volume level. \nThese costs are also known as capacity costs, period costs or stand - by \ncosts; for example, rent, property taxes, supervisor’s salary, advertising, \ninsurance etc.  \n \nii) \nVariable costs: \n \nVariable cost are those costs which vary directly and \nproportionately with the output. There is a constant ratio between the \nchange in the cost and the change in the level of output. Direct materials \nand labour are the examples of variable costs. Thus, all these costs which \ntend to vary directly with variations in volume of output are variable costs. \nHowever, it must be remembered that variable costs remain the same or \napproximately the same in amount per unit of production regardless of \nincrease or decrease in volume.",

These costs vary in some \ndegree with volume but not in direct proportion. Such costs are fixed only \nin relation to specified constant conditions. Semi fixed costs are those \ncosts which remain constant upto a certain level of output after which they \nbecome variable. For example: maintenance of building, depreciation of \nplant, supervisor’s salary, telephone expenses etc. \n \n10.4 COST SHEET \n \nCost sheet is a statement prepared to present the detailed costs \nof total output during a period. It provides information relating to cost per \nunit at different stages of total cost of production. The preparation of cost \nsheet is one of the important and primary function of cost accounting. \nCost sheet is not an account. There is a prescribed form for preparation \nof cost sheet. A cost sheet is a statement of cost prepared for a given \nperiod of time in such a manner that it indicates various elements of cost \nas clearly as possible. The cost sheet is useful in ascertaining the total \ncost of production per unit, formulation of production plan, fixing up the \nselling price and minimize the production cost. Sometimes standard cost \ndata are provided to facilitate comparison with the actual cost increased. \nThe preparation of the cost sheet requires understanding of the treatment \nof the following items:- \n \na) \nStock of raw materials : The opening and closing stock of raw \nmaterials are to be adjusted with purchase of Raw materials in \norder to determine the value of raw materials consumed for the \noutput produced. Carriage/ Freight inward and Octroi on purchase \netc. also to be added to purchases. This is a part of Prime Cost. \n \nb) \nStock of Work in Process – The value of stock of work in \nprocess is a part of Factory cost and therefore, it should be \nadjusted with factory overheads. Sale of scrap should be \ndeducted from the factory overheads in order to determine the \ntotal factory cost. \n \nc) \nStock of Finished goods :- Finished goods covers the products \non which factory work has been completed. It is the cost of \ncompleted production. The opening and closing values of finished \ngoods are to be adjusted with the total cost of production in order \nto arrive at cost of sales.",

It comprises of those \nexpenses which could be traced directly to it. The prime cost consists of \ncost of direct materials, direct labour and direct expenses. Direct \nexpenses include special expenses which can be identified with product \nor job and are charged directly to the product as part of the prime cost. \nFor example cost of hiring special plant or machinery, cost of special \nmoulds, design or patterns, Architect’s fees, Royalties, License fees etc. \n \nii) \nWork cost: \n \nWorks cost of a Product consists of prime cost plus the portion of \nworks or factory expenses chargeable against the Production. Works or \nfactory expenses include, indirect materials indirect labour and indirect \nexpenses. Indirect materials refer to those materials that are needed for \nthe completion of the product but the consumption of these materials is \neither so small or complex that it would not be appropriate to treat it as \ndirect materials. These are supplies that cannot be conveniently and \neconomically charged to a specific unit of output. For example, lubricants, \ncotton waste, works stationery etc. \n \n \nIndirect labour is that labour which does not affect the construction \nor the composition of the finished product. This is the labour cost of \nproduction related activities that cannot be associated with or \nconveniently traced to specific product through physical observation. For \nexample, Foremen’s salary and salary of employees engaged in \nmaintenance or service work. Indirect expenses covers all expenditure \nincurred by the manufacturer from the time of production to its completion \nas delivery to customer by  way of rate of product. Any cannot be allocate \nbut which can be apportioned to or absorbed by the cost cehtres cost",

It is a monetary amount that is paid to acquire goods or \nservices. Costing is the process of determining the cost of doing \nsomething. Cost is composed of three elements - materials, labour and \nexpenses or overheads. Each of these costs can be further classified as \n(a) Direct (b) Indirect. Cost can also be classified on the basis of function, \nvariability and elements. Cost sheet is  a statement prepared to present \nthe detailed cost of total output during a period. It provides information \nrelating to cost per unit at different stages of the total cost of production. \nThere are certain expenses which are not considered while preparing the \ncost sheet, such as Dividend. Income tax, Interest on loan, Donation paid, \nCapital expenditure, Writing off goodwill and Provisions. Prime Cost, \nWork Cost, Cost of Production and Cost of sales are the different \nelements of costs.  \n \n10.6 BOOKS RECOMMENDED:  \n \nCost accounting & Costing methods – Wheldon \nCost Accounting –Jawahar Lal  \n \n10.7 TERMINAL EXERCISES:  \n \n1. \nWhat is cost?

While the cost accountant has prepared a cost \nsheet for the same period and arrived at a profit of Rs.5,12,000. You feel \nthat one of the figures reported should be wrong, otherwise how could \nthere be a difference. \n \n \nHowever, there is a logical explanation for the difference in the \nprofit figures and both may be right. \n \n \nThis is because the fundamental assumptions made by the two \naccountants for preparing the profit and loss account vary. For example, \nInterest on loan will be debited in financial Profit & Loss Account but the \ncost accountant will ignore this item as he does not consider this interest \nexpense as an item of cost. Naturally, in this case, the cost accountant \nwill report a higher profit than the financial account. \n \n \nIn the following sections we shall see the types of differences and \nthe items which give rise to these differences. \n \n11.2 NEED FOR RECONCILIATION \n \n \nThe need for reconciliation arises due to the following reasons : \n \na) \nTo ensure that no income or expenditure item has been omitted and \nthat there is no under or over recovery of overheads.",

Hence, \nthe ascertainment and control of these costs are important aspects. \nProper accounting and control over material purchase, consumption and \ninventories are important aspects of effective management. Labour is also \nan essential factor of production. Therefore, it is necessary to use \ndifferent methods of time keeping, time booking, wage payments and pay \nroll accounting and treatment of idle time and overtime in cost accounts. \nFactory overheads are opening costs of a business enterprise which \ncannot be traced directly to a particular unit of output. It is the aggregate \nof indirect materials. Labour and expenses.",

The term materials and stores are used \nin the same sense. However, stores is a wider term and comprises many \nother items besides raw materials. It includes tools, equipment’s \nmaintenance and repairs items, factory supplies, components, jigs, \nfixtures etc. \n \nDIRECT AND INDIRECT MATERIALS \n \n \nMaterials can be classified as direct and indirect materials. The \nmaterials which can be easily identified and attributed to the individual \nunits are known as direct materials.  \n \nFor example, leather used in manufacture of shoes. These materials form \npart of the finished goods. All costs, which are incurred to obtain direct \nmaterials are also known as direct materials for example carriage inward, \noctroi etc. \n \n \n \nIndirect materials on the other hand, do not form part of the \nfinished product and cannot be conveniently and accurately allocated to a \nparticular unit of product. For example, consumable stores, cotton waste, \nlubricating oil etc. Cost associated with indirect materials are also \nincluded in the cost of indirect materials. The grouping of materials into \ndirect and indirect sometimes, become a matter of convenience. \n \nPURCHASE OF MATERIALS  \n \n \nThere is a purchase department which carries out the function of \npurchases of materials. The purchase manager is responsible for \nensuring the items ordered are of the standard quality, lower cost and \nreceived in time. The purchase procedure vary with different business \nfirms. The purchase procedure is given below:",

It serves the dual purpose of authorizing the purchase \ndepartment to make purchases and provides a record of the description \nand quantity of materials required. It also fixes the responsibility of the \ndepartment or personnel making purchase requisition. \n \nb) \nPurchase order:- \n \n \nAfter receiving the duly approved requisition, the purchase \ndepartment has to place an order with a supplier. It is an offer to buy \ncertain materials at stated price and terms. For routine purchases, the \norder is placed through established supplies. In other cases, the purchase \ndepartment may ask for bids or send out request for quotation before \nplacing an order. The purchase order is a formal contract for the supply of \nmaterials. Copies of the purchase order are sent to the departments \nconcerned. \n \nc) \nReceiving and Inspection of materials: \n \n \nThe stores department is responsible for taking delivery of \npackages and to get a physical verification of the contents. When the \nmaterials are received, the stores official gets the packages, open them \nand make a detailed verification of the contents. After the contents of the \npackages are checked, the details are entered into a Goods Received \nNote. Copies of the G.R.Note are issued to the supplier, purchase and \naccounts department, where the factory has to test the materials received \nfor quality and specifications. It has to ensure that the quality of materials \nis as per purchase order. \n \nd) \nApproval of Invoices and Payment \n \n    \nInvoice received by the purchase department is forwarded to the \nAccounts department for payment with their recommendation. Accounts \ndepartment has to check the authenticity, arithmetical accuracy and G. R. \nNote in order to make sure that the goods are as per purchase order.",

It is known as storekeeping. It is \nphysical storage of materials. The storekeeper is appointed to look after \nthis work in the stores department. The storekeeper should have the \ntechnical knowledge and experience in stores routine and storekeeping. \nHe has to ensure regular supply event overstocking and under stocking \nand minimize the cost of materials. The storekeeper has to perform the \nfollowing functions: \n \ni) \nReceipts of materials.  \nii) \nIssue purchase requisitions. \niii) Maintain proper record of receipt, issue and balance stock of \nmaterials. \niv) Placing and arranging materials at proper place. \nv) \nIssue of materials against proper authorization. \nvi) Minimizing storage handling and maintaining costs. \nvii) Ensure that the stock neither exceed maximum level or go below the \nminimum level. \n \n12.4 ISSUE OF MATERIALS  \n \n \nAll materials in the stores are meant for issue to various \ndepartments.

For this purpose, a number of \nmethods of pricing the issue of materials are used which are as follows:- \n \na) \nFIFO Method :- The first in first out method is used when the \nmaterials received but are to be issued first. The price of the earliest lot/ \nquantity is taken first and then for the next lot. The value of closing stock \nconfirms more or less, to the current market price. This method is suitable \nfor falling price. \n \nb) \nLIFO Method : - The last in first out method, is used when  \nmaterials received last are issued first. The storekeeper will charge the \ncost price of the latest lot purchased. This is suitable in the times of rising \nprices. \n \nd) Average Rate Method:- Under this method the materials \nare issued at a price which is an average price of materials \npurchased. The simple average is an average of prices \nwithout having regard to the quantities involved. Weighted \naverage price is used in order to avoid fluctuation in price \nand reduce the number of calculations. Weighted average \nof the total cost and total quantities of materials purchased. \nis calculated each time a purchase is made.",

In trading concerns, inventories \nconsist of merchandise held for sale and packing  and other supplies. \nInventory control is the technique of maintaining inventory items at \ndesired levels. It is a system which ensures the required quantity of \ninventories of the required quality, at the required time and with the \nminimum price. The function of inventory turnover is to obtain maximum \ninventory turnover with the sufficient stock to meet all requirements. \nInventory control is of great importance in almost all types of business \norganizations. If inventories are kept at high levels due to over production \nor slow demand, capital is tied up which cannot be used for other \nproductive purposes. Alternatively, production is likely to suffer due to \ninadequate inventory on hand. \n \n12.6 MATERIAL LOSSES \n \n \nSome material losses are bound to occur during manufacturing \noperations due to the nature of materials. These losses may be in the \nform of scrap, spoilage, defectives or wastage. Scrap is residue for \nmanufacturing operations that has measurable but relatively minor \nrecovery value. It is saleable material resulting from the primary \nmanufacturing operations. Scrap should be accounted for in some \nmanner not only from the point of view of efficiency but because scrap is \noften a tempting source of theft. If the value of scrap is very insignificant, it \nis not considered in the cost accounts, on the other hand, if the value of \nscrap is significant it deducted from the material cost.     \n \n \nSpoilage can be defined as the materials which in the process of \nmanufacture are badly damaged or have developed some imperfection \nwhich cannot be economically correct and thus the goods should be sold \nas seconds. The loss due to spoilage may be charged to a specific \nproduct or job on which the spoilage occurred, if it is clearly traceable to \nthe work done on that order. The normal spoilage loss may be charged to \nfactory overhead and thus spread over the cost of all jobs or products. \nThe cost of abnormal spoilage is transferred to the costing profit and loss \naccount. Abnormal loss is unexpected and should have been avoided by \nthe management.",

The accounting treatment for defectives is \nsimilar to that relating to spoiled goods. \n \n \nWastage generally, refers to that portion of raw materials which \nare lost in storing, handling and in manufacturing process. It does not \npossess any recovery of realizable value . Waste can be classified as \nnormal \nand \nabnormal \nwaste. \nNormal \nwaste \nis \nexpected \nand \nuncontrollable.

The bin cards are usually attached to  or \nplaced near to the bin so that receipts and issues may be entered therein \nas soon as they take place. Separate bin cards are prepared for each \nitem of stores. Thus, bin card provides a continuous record of the stock in \neach bin and assist the storekeeper to control the stock. For each \nmaterials, the maximum stock to be held are noted on the card. An \nordering level is also indicated therein so that fresh supplies may be \nordered before the minimum is reached.

It is a human resource \nand participates in the process of production. Wages paid to labour is a \nsignificant item of cost. The labour cost should be distinguished between \ndirect and indirect labour. Direct labour cost can be identified with and \ncharged directly to the product or a job whereas, indirect labour cost is not \nso identifiable and, therefore, it is included in overheads which may be \nallocated to different products or department on some suitable basis. Cost \naccounting for labour has three primary objectives :- \n \na) Determining labour costs in the cost of product or service  \nb) Reporting labour costs for planning and control and  \nc) Reporting labour costs for decision-making.",

Various departments contribute to the efficient utilisation of \nlabour and adequate control over costs. Personnel department has to \nprovide an efficient labour force. The engineering department maintains \ncontrol over working conditions and production methods for each job and \ndepartment or process by preparing plans and specifications. Time-\nkeeping department maintains an accurate record of the time spent by \neach employee. Preparation of the pay roll from the clock cards, job or \ntime tickers or time sheets is done by the pay roll department.

In addition to \nrecording of time of arrival and departure of workers it is also necessary to \nrecord time spent by workers on each job, order or process which is \nknown as time booking. The system of time booking may be maintained \neither manually or mechanically. Time recording clocks may be used to \nenter the time of starting and finishing each job separately on the job \ncards. Time booking can be made with daily time sheets, weekly time \nsheets or job cards. The specimen of time card is as follows:-",

The work \ninvolves the calculation of wages, deductions, net wages payable to \nemployees etc. The gross wages payable to each worker are computed \nwith the help of time card, job card or piece work card.  Certain statutory \ndeductions are also made from the gross wages. The wage sheet is \nprepared showing the gross wages, deductions and net wages payable to \nworkers. It is prepared at periodical intervals according to the time of \nwage payment. Normally, wage sheet are prepared separately for \ndepartment. But this wage sheet should be checked properly to minimize \nthe possibilities of wrong payments either deliberately or inadvertently. \nDetection and prevention of both errors and frauds, including the checking \nfor dummy workers in wage sheet, need attention to ensure accuracy in \nwage payments. \n \n12.11  IDLE TIME \n \n \nIdle time is a period or duration for which workers are paid but they \nhave not worked for production in the factory.

Idle time does not include \nholidays, leave etc. It may be normal in nature or abnormal. Normal idle \ntime is that idle time which is unavoidable; it is of normal nature and is \ninherent in a production or work environment. Normal idle time is caused \ndue to the movement of workers. Abnormal idle time is that time which is \nnot caused by the usual routine of production. The time wasted by the \nworkers may represent abnormal idle time.

Similar \noverhead cost items should be grouped together. The grouping of \noverheads is done through a technique called `Codification’. It is a \nmethod of identification and describing various overhead expenses in \nnumbers or letter or in combination of both, so that cost data can be \neasily collected. Codification of the entire items is done through a proper \ncoding system. Overheads are collected through the sources of stores \nrequisitions, financial accounts, wage sheets, registers and reports. \n \n12.15 ALLOCATION OF OVERHEADS \n \n \nAllocation of overheads is the `allotment’ of all items of cost of cost \ncentres or cost to units. It refers to charging overheads to the cost \ncentres. It means that overheads have been incurred because of the \nexistence of that cost centre. When the company provides more than one \nproduct, factory overheads are allocated to various production \ndepartments or cost centres. Proper overheads allocation is of great \nimportance as wrong allocation can distort income determination, asset \nvaluation and performance evaluation. The overhead allocation process is \nas follows:- \ni) \nAccumulating overheads on the basis of departments or products. \nii) \nIdentifying the cost objectives of the allocated costs \niii) Selecting the method of relating costs so accumulated to the cost \nobjectives.",

APPORTIONMENT OF OVERHEADS: \n \n \nApportionment of Overheads refers to the distribution of common \nitems of cost to two or more cost centres on some appropriate basis. \nWhen overheads are incurred for the factory as a whole and benefit two \nor more cost centres, it is necessary to apportion them to different \ndepartments that receive benefits from such overhead costs. For \nexample, factory rent benefits all the departments, hence it should be \napportioned to all the departments on the basis of the floor area occupied \nby each department in factory. Thus, common factory overheads have to \nbe apportioned to various production and service departments in the \nfactory on some appropriate basis. \n \nA production department is one that engages in the actual \nmanufacture of product. On the other hand, service department is one \nthat renders a service which contributes indirectly in the manufacture of \nthe product. It renders services to the production as well as other service \ndepartments. \n \n \nThe common factory overheads are to be apportioned to various \nproduction and service departments on some equitable basis which are \ncalled principles of apportionment. Accordingly, overheads are distributed \nover various departments on the basis of actual benefit received or \npotential benefits to be received by the respective departments \nOverheads can also be apportioned on the specific criteria or given ratio \nwhich may be determined after careful survey for different service \nfunctions. Apportionment of overheads can also be made on the basis of \nability to pay (Revenue) of the departments. \n \n \nThe usual basis of apportionment of common items of factory \noverheads can be stated a follows:- \n \n \nItems of Overheads  \nBasis of Apportionment  \na. \nRents rates, taxes and Insurance \n- Floor space/ area occupied  \n \n \n \ndepreciation & repairs of buildings \nb. \nCanteen, welfare expenses \n- No. of employees  \n \n \n \nTime keeping & Personnel office",

These are the important methods of Product costing. \nThese methods are used for determining the unit cost of production and \nkeeping detailed records supporting the work in Process inventory.

It \nis used in the industries which are engaged in manufacturing exclusively \none homogeneous product or a few grades of the same product. It is also \ncalled as single or output costing. Unit is also called as single or output \ncosting. Unit cost is the average cost of production. The examples of \nindustries are Cement, Paper, Sugar, Steel etc. The computation of cost \nis done in the form of cost sheet.  \n \n \nBatch costing is concerned with producing a large quantity of \nproducts which could be stocked and sold later on. A batch is a cost unit \nconsisting of a group of identical items which maintain their identity \nthrough one or more stages of production. A lot is the quantity of product \nwhich can be conveniently and economically produced and costed. The \ncompanies which produce shoes, medicines, drugs and nuts & bolts use",

All the jobs are not similar. They do not pass \nthrough the same manufacturing process. Each job requires different \namount of materials and labour and different levels of skills. Therefore, \nthe cost of each job differs from other. The cost is recorded separately for \neach job. Each job or batch is regarded as a cost unit from the view point \nof accumulation. For example, Printing jobs, Automobile repairs, \nHospitals, Ship-uniters have to follow job costing.  \n \n \nA job cost sheet is prepared on receipt of an order. A specific \nnumber  is allotted to each job put into production. General information in \nrespect of the job is recorded at the top of the job-sheet. Appropriate \ninputs are recorded in the job cost sheet regarding direct materials, labour \nand overheads. Additional information such as labour-hours, machine \nhours, quanity and quality of materials used are also recorded for the \npurpose of planning controlling cost and evaluating performance. Finally \nthe profit or loss on the job can be easily determined. The job cost sheet \nalso provides for the comparison of the actual cost with the estimated \ncosts.",

In a process costing system the type of \nproduction is such that a continuous flow of output of identical products is \nproduced.  \n \nThere is no unit with an individual identity because each unit is part of a \nprocess. This method is used in industries like chemicals, textiles, rubber, \ncement, sugar, coal etc. It can also be used in the assembly type \nindustries which manufacture items like typewriters, automobiles, radios \nand TV’s etc. Therefore, process costing is usefully applied when \nproducts are manufactured under conditions of continuous processing or \nunder mass production method.",

For example, electricity, \ndepreciation, hire charges of equipments etc.  \n \nManufacturing Overheads : \n \n \nOverheads are generally high in the process costing. The \noverheads have to be analysed and apportioned on some equitable basis \nover the different processes involved.

In process industries, production losses are inevitable and \noutput is always less than the input. Thus, when the output is less than \nthe input the difference is known as process loss, Even though the loss is \ninevitable, it is still essential that accurate records are maintained and \nsuitable steps are taken to minimize the process loss. Since it affect the \nproduction costs, it should be pointed out to the foremen and supervisors \nfor ensuring efficiency in the use of material in future. They may have \nkeen inspection at each stage of production and losses can be reduced in \nfuture. Process loss can be divided into two categories (i) Normal loss and \n(ii) Abnormal loss.  \n \n(i) \nNormal loss :- Centrain losses can be anticipated and an \nestimate of such loss can be made depending upon the material \nused, production operation involved, equipment used, technology \nemployed and other factors.

The value of By \nproduct is generally less than the values of main products.

It is also known as service \ncosting. It is suitable for the business such as transport, electricity, \nhospital, canteens and hotels, banking etc. Operating costing is designed \nto determine the cost of services rendered by an organization. It is a form \nof unit costing which is applied to costing of services.  \n \n \nOperating costs are period costs. Expenses accumulated for a \nperiod are related to the quantum of services rendered during the period. \nThe method of collection and analysis of cost is similar to single cost \nsystem. Direct materials and their costs are obtained from voucher or \nmaterial requisitions. Information about direct labour is collected from \nwage records. Overhead costs are allocated on the basis of cost units. \nThe following cost units are generally applied in different service \norganizations.",

Only variable manufacturing costs \nare considered as product costs including direct materials direct labour \nand variable factory overheads. Fixed factory overheads are not \nconsidered as product costs and are not used for determination of value \nof inventories and cost of goods sold. Fixed costs are excluded from the \ncost of the products. Fixed manufacturing costs are treated as period \ncosts. Fixed manufacturing overheads are written off to the Profit and \nLoss account in the period they are incurred.  \n \n \nMarginal cost means variable production cost. These costs tend to \nvary in direct proportion to the changes in the production level. Marginal \ncost is the amount at any given volume of output by which aggregate \ncosts are changed if the volume of output is increased or decreased by \none unit. Thus, marginal cost is equal to prime cost plus variable \noverheads. This technique of marginal costing differentiate between fixed \nand variable costs for finding out the effect of changes in the volume of",

It is in other words, setting of \npredetermined cost estimates in order to provide a basis for comparison \nwith actual costs.

Standards are \ndeveloped for Materials, Labour and Overheads. The two standards \ndeveloped for Materials are Material quantity Standards and Material price \nstandards. The standard used for labour cost standard requires the \ndetermination of standard capacity and standard overhead costs can be \ncomputed using normal capacity. The normal or expected actual capacity \naims at a production level according to an existing set of conditions. \nStandard costs require continuous review and revision. A Company \nshould establish a programme to raise standards whenever required so \nthat standards can be set at a currently attainable level.",
