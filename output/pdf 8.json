II.—Remarks on the similarity of a passage in Marlowe's\nEdward II. and one in the First Part of the Contention.\n\nMalone, in his Essay on the Chronological Order of Shake-\nspeare’s plays, has given us a very imperfect argument in\nsupport of his latest opinion, that Marlowe was the author of\nthe “ True Tragedie,” and probably also of the first part of the\n“Contention,” merely adducing two passages of remote simi-\nlarity, but sufficient, in his estimation, to overthrow his previous\narguments in favour of attributing the authorship of them to\nPeele and Greene. The two well known lines—\n\n“ What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster\nSink into the ground! I thought it would have mounted.”\n\nare compared by Farmer to two others in Edward II.—\n\n“—_——Scorning that the lowly earth\nShould drink his blood, mounts up to the air.”\n\nThe same thought, it will be observed, though expressed in\ndifferent language and under different circumstances. Malone\nalso found the expression “‘ aspiring Lancaster” in Marlowe's\nplay ; and on these coincidences, if they can be so called, he\nhas at once jumped to the conclusion that Marlowe was the\nwriter of both dramas, in opposition to the results he had\narrived at with so much learning in his celebrated Essay on\nthe three parts of Henry VI.\n\nT have recently observed a far more important evidence than\neither of these, and as it seems to have entirely escaped the\nnotice of the critics, it may be considered of sufficient im-\nportance for a short paper for the Shakespeare Society.

It shows clearly enough, that thete\nis some history attached to the authorship of those plays, I\nmean the first and second parts of the “Contention,” that still\nremains to be unravelled ; and it considerably strengthens the\nargument by which I endeavoured to prove, that the ground-\nwork was not by Shakespeare, however unwilling we may be to\nbelieve that our poet was not the writer of a part of them.\nTaken in connexion with this last found evidence of the hand\nof Marlowe having been engaged in them, the similarities\nadduced by Malone are by no means devoid of weight. I\nmay also add another, which occurs only a few lines after-\nwards—\n\n“The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas.”\nIn the “ True Tragedie,” 1595, repr. p. 124, we have—\n“ Sterne Fawconbridge commands the narrow seas.”\n\nThis may probably be of still less impgrtance than those ad-\nduced by Malone, but I cannot help thinking that any reader\nwho will regard these similarities impartially, more especially\nin connexion with the one just discovered, which could not by\nany possibility have been the result of chance, and who, by the\nbye, has not entirely eschewed verbal criticism, will come to\nthe conclusion that the probabilities are now greatly in favour\nof Marlowe being the original author, or at least one of the\noriginal authors of the two dramas upon which Shakespeare",

Such is precisely my case: the publi-\ncation of “ The Alleyn Papers,” and the curious matters they\ncontain, led me to search my own receptacles of “ unconsidered\ntrifles,” in hopes of finding something that might answer the pur-\npose, and be worthy of insertion among the proposed miscellany\nof the Shakespeare Society. My father and my grandfather\nhad got a good many small manuscripts together, but generally\nrelating to heraldry, or to some of “the six follies of’ science,”\nas Mr. Pettigrew calls them, in his not less learned than\namusing volume recently printed, on “the Superstitions con-\nnected with Medicine and Surgery.” However, among them\nI discovered two or three of a different kind, relating to poets,\npoetry, and players, and copies of these I subjoin in order to\ncontribute what I can to the general stock of information. The\nfirst is a scrap from Robert Daborne, the dramatist, whose name\noccurs so often in “The Alleyn Papers,” and it appears to be\nconnected in subject with the note on p. 63 of that work ; and\nwe may gather from it that Daborne had mortgaged his estate.\nThe Mr. Benfield mentioned in it must have been Robert\nBenfield, the actor, of whom we hear frequently at about the\ntime of Shakespeare's retirement from the stage. The note is\nupon @ small square piece of paper, and to whom it was\naddressed is not stated, but we may perhaps conclude that it\nwas to Henslowe, who had advanced small sums to Daborne",

I was not aware,\nuntil very recently, that there was in Shakespeare’s time a well-\n\nknown dance, called “ the passing measure pavin ;” and it is to-\n\nthis that Sir Toby clearly alludes. ‘“ Dick surgeon” has passed\nhis measures in getting drunk, and these words instantly bring\n“pavin” to the knight’s mind, which was not inappropriate,\nbecause, as stated in the note, (Shakespeare’s Works, iii., 413,\nedit. 1844) a pavin was “a slow, heavy movement, such as a\ndrunken man might be supposed to execute in his intoxication.”\nMusical authorities tell us, that ‘‘ passy-measures,” as it stands\nin the old copies, is a corruption of passamezzo, and such may\nbe the fact ; but nobody seems to have known, any more than\nmyself, that there was a dance, in which Queen Elizabeth must\noften have joined, called “the passing measure pavin.”\n\nI have before me a list of thirteen dances, in a manuscript",

CAMPBELL’S LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE.\n\nArt. 1X.—Mr. Campbell's Life of Shakespeare.\n\nIn Mr. Campbell’s Life of Shakespeare, prefixed to Moxon’'s\nedition, in one volume, 1838, there is a beautiful passage\nrelating to “The Tempest,” in which, however, a singular\noversight is committed, which it may be worth while to point\nout. It occurs where the author of “ The Pleasures of Hope”\nis speaking of ‘“‘The Tempest” as our great dramatist’s\nlast work, and drawing a parallel between Prospero burying\nhis magic staff and drowning his book, and Shakespeare laying\naside what Milton calls his ‘singing robes,” relinquishing the\nmagic art he had so long practised in connection with the stage,\nand retiring to his native town. Mr. Campbell’s expressions,\nand no better could well be chosen, are these :—\n\n“The Tempest,’ however, has a sort of sacredness, as the\nlast work of the mighty workman. Shakespeare, as if conscious\nthat it would be his last, and as if inspired to typify himself,\nhas made its hero a natural, dignified, and benevolent magi-\ncian, who could conjure up spirits from the vasty deep, and\ncommand supernatural agency by the most seemingly natural\nand simple means. — And this final play of our poet has\nmagic, indeed ; for what can be simpler in language than the\ncourtship of Ferdinand and Miranda, and yet what can be\nmore magical than, the sympathy with which it subdues us?\nHere Shakespeare himself is Prospero, or rather the superior\ngenius who commands both Prospero and Ariel. But the time\nwas approaching when the potent sorcerer was to break his\nstaff, and bury it fathoms in the ocean—\n\n‘Deeper than did ever plummet sound.’\n\nThat staff has never been and never will be recovered.” p.

I mean that, although most of the known\ncopies are dated 1623, there is at least one copy in existence\nwith the date of 1622; showing, perhaps, that there was ‘an\nintention to publish the volume in 1622, although it was not\nregistered in the books of the Stationers’ Company until No-\nvember 8, 1623. In the same way, there is a single copy of\nthe third folio, dated 1663, and not 1664, like all the others\nknown: it has also the portrait on the title-page, (omitting\nany mention of the attributed plays) and not on the fly-leaf.\nThese matters may seem trifling to some, but to me nothing\nrelating to Shakespeare can be a trifle.\n\nL.

I would, however, premise that I see no\nabsolute necessity for altering the pronunciation, save the\nentire dropping of the comma in the middle of the line.\n\nThe comma, indeed, is entirely a modern introduction ; and\nin a copy of the second folio belonging to me the hyphen is\nfound exactly as I have given it above.

It may be that he unconsciously fell into the mistake\nof supposing the line his own. In act iii., sc. 2, of “The\nCenci,” we meet with a copy of a well-remembered passage\nin “Othello.” Shelley makes Giacomo thus contemplate the\nmurder of his father, likening the flame of life to the flame\nof a lamp burning near him :—\n\n“ And yet, once quench’d, I cannot thus relume\nMy father’s life.”\n\nSo Othello (act v., sc. 2), meditating the murder of Desde-\nmona, and contemplating her by the light of a lamp, says :—\n\n“If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,\n\nI can again thy former light restore,\n\nShould I repent me ; but once put out thy light,\nThou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,\n\nI know not where is that Promethean heat\n\nThat can thy light relume.”\n\nShelley was fond of the figure; for just before, looking at\nthe lamp, Giacomo exclaims :—\n\n“ But that no power can fill with vital oil\nThat broken lamp of flesh.”\n\nJust afterwards, in the same scene, we have a passage which\ncould not have been written, or at all events not so worded,",

Orsino is supposing that Beatrice, by permitting\ncrime, may in the end become criminal :—\n\n“ subdued even to the hue\nOf that which thou permittest.”\n\nHere we have an imitation, or, more strictly, a copy of a\ncouplet in Shakespeare’s 91st Sonnet, where he is reflecting\nupon his own mode of life as a player, then looked down upon\nas most degraded, and to the colour it may give to his whole\nexistence. I transcribe the opening of the Sonnet, in order to\nmake the point more intelligible, but only the two last lines\nare closely: applicable, for Shelley omits the familiar image by\nwhich Shakespeare so admirably illustrates his meaning.\n\n“OQ! for my sake do you with fortune chide,\nThe guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\nThat did not better for my life provide,\nThan public means, which public manners breeds :\nThence comes it that my name receives a brand ;\nAnd almost thence my nature is subdued\nTo what it works in—like the dyer’s hand.”\n\nJ.

XIV.—Albion, Knight ; a Moral Play.\n\nThe following is a fragment of an early dramatic perform-\nance, which, as far as is at present known, has no parallel in\nour language. It is part of a political play, and the only part\nthat has been preserved: not merely no perfect copy has come\ndown to us, but no portion of a copy but that which we have\nbeen permitted to use, and which is in the library of His Grace\nthe Duke of Devonshire.\n\nIt consists of twelve closely printed pages in black letter, and\nseems to have been considerably less than half of the entire\nproduction. I noticed it in “ The History of English Dramatic\nPoetry and the Stage,” ii., 369; but I could only there insert\nsome brief specimens of it, and it seems to me to deserve re-\nprinting exactly in the form in which it has reached us, in order\nthat those who are curious respecting the productions of our\nearly stage may have an opportunity of judging for themselves\nof the singular nature and character of the performance.\n\nWhether it was ever acted, and where, are questions it is\nimpossible to answer. In Cotton MS. Vitellius, F. v. (now\nprinting by the Camden Society, under the superintendence of\nMr. J. G. Nichols) we find the following memorandum appli-\ncable to Christmas, 1559: ‘“‘ The same day at nyght, at the\nQuene’s court, there was a play afore her Grace, the which the\nplaers plade, shuche matter that they wher commandyd to leyff\noff, and continently the maske cam in dansing.” The MS.\nconsists of notes of singular events, many of them witnessed by\nthe writer, in the reigns of Edward VI. and Mary, and in the\nbeginning of that of Elizabeth ; but he does not say that he was\npresent at: the time the players were commanded to leave off\non account of the objectionable nature of the drama they were\nrepresenting ; neither have we the smallest hint as to the title\nof the play, but we may perhaps infer that it was political, and,\ngoing one step farther, (a considerable step, I admit) we may",

My reason for now taking up my pen is to\npoint out an early proof, not so much of the popularity of\nGreene as an author, (which, indeed, requires no evidence)\nbut of the scarcity of some of his works, even as early as\n1602: it is well-known that when any of them are now sold,\neven if they consist of only a few leaves, they produce many\nguineas ; and nine years after the death of their author, it\nseems, they were not ordinarily to be met with in booksellers’\nshops, and that some difficulty might be experienced in pro-\neuring them.\n\nThis fact we have upon the testimony of Samuel Row-\nlands, a notorious and humorous pamphleteer of the time of\nShakespeare, to whom has always been attributed a very\npleasant tract, first published in 1602, under the title of\n\n“Tis merrie when Gossips meete.

As the letter is published in two com-\nmon books,' I cannot suppose that it is not sufficiently well\nknown ; but it is very possible that, attracted by its manly\nsentiments and the calm dignity of its style, those who have\nperused it have overlooked its indirect bearing upon the history\nof the drama.\n\nThe letter is dated “at Utrecht, this 24th March, 1586 ;”\nand the original, from which I shall quote, exists in the Har-\nleian MS., 287, fol. 1.\n\nThe admirable writer was then engaged in that war for the\nindependence of the Low Countries in which a few months\nafterwards he found an honourable grave. The Earl of Ley-\ncester had recently accepted the office of Governor-general of\nthe United Provinces, and Sir Philip Sydney, and all the\nother followers of the earl, were paying the penalty of his am-\nbitious vanity in the stoppage of their supplies, which followed\nupon Queen Elizabeth’s disapprobation of the step taken by\nher favourite. In the midst of their troubles, whilst the sol-\ndiers were mutinous for want of pay, and, in a foreign country\nand during a rigorous spring, were suffering the conjoined\nhardships of defective clothing and insufficient food, Sydney\nwrites thus to Mr. Secretary Walsyngham, his father-in-law :—\n\n“Such is the goodwil it pleaseth you to bear me, that my\npart of the trouble is something that troubles you, but I beseech\nyow let it not.

But she is but a\nmeans whom God useth ; and I know not whether I am de-\nceaved, but I am faithfully persuaded, that, if she shold with-\ndraw her self, other springes wold ryse to help this action ; for\nmethinks I see the great work indeed in hand against the\nabusers of the world, wherein it is no greater fault to have con-\nfidence in mans power, then it is hastily to despair of Gods\nwork.

My own opinion, founded upon these\ncircumstances, is that the “ Will” alluded to was one of the\npersons I have enumerated. :\n\nNor do I see much reason to doubt that he was the same\n“Will” who is described as the representative of Itys in the\nplat of Tarlton’s Seven Deadlye Sinns. It would be strange\nindeed if, at about the same time and in the samg company,\ntwo persons were both termed by the same familiar appellation.\nIf this be thought probable, we get rid of Sly from the four\npersons amongst whom we are to look for “ Will,” because Sly\nis set down in ‘the plat referred to as a distinct person from\n“Will.” Our choice is thus limited to Johnson, Kempe, and\nShakespeare.\n\nNow that Shakespeare was a light-hearted, frolicsome man\nis clear from the deer-stealing ; that he was witty in conversa-\ntion is to be inferred from his daughter’s epitaph ; that he was\ntermed “Will Shakespeare” is certain ; but I must at once\nexpress my own conviction that Sir Philip Sidney never could\nhave applied to him the terms “jesting player” and “ knave,”\neven allowing that the latter word might not be used in the\nmodern offensive sense. Shakespeare’s earliest works bear\nupon them the stamp of a mind far too contemplative and re-\nfined for its possessor ever to have been regarded as a jester or\nbuffoon ; besides which, the only traces that we have of him as\nan actor are in old Adam and the ghost in Hamlet, certainly\nnot humorous characters. In my own opinion, therefore, the\nchoice lies between Johnson and Kempe.\n\nOf Johnson we know literally nothing more than I have\nstated. He is not mentioned in the list of players in the first",

To him, I think, those\nwords, in all probability, refer, giving us proof that, before the\ndeath of Tarlton, he had joined the Blackfriars’ company, and\nhad acquired a reputation which entitled him, when Tarlton\ndied, to be his successor, as well “in the favour of her majesty\nas in the good thoughts of the general audience.” *\n\nA second question, suggested by the words of Sir Philip\nSydney is, whether the Earl of Leycester’s players did not\naccompany him into the Low Countries?\n\nIt was an occasion upon which Leycester was particularly\nanxious to display his power and grandeur. He carried over\nwith him a body-guard of 500 men, levied amongst his tenants\nand retainers, and the passage before us countenances the\nrumour (although it was afterwards thought politic to deny\nthat there ever had been any such intention) that his countess\nwas about to join him, for the express purpose of increasing the\nsplendour of his court. At such a time, it is not unlikely that\nhis players were present. Entertainments of a dramatic\ncharacter, although more nearly resembling pageants or\nmasques than plays, were exhibited before the earl on various\noccasions, and one instance has come under my notice, in\nreference to which it may be certainly said, that the performers\nwere not native players.

This fact probably\nexplains how it is that we find “Will” set down in the plot of Frederick\nand Basilea (Malone iii., 357), as well as in that of Tarlton’s Seven\nDeadlye Sinns.

Now, the earl was appointed to the command\nin the Low Countries in September, 1585, and immediately\nafterwards sent out letters to his friends and retainers, re-\nquesting them to accompany him thither. From Warwick-\nshire, and especially from the neighbourhood of his domain at\nKenilworth, his 500 men were in great part procured.

XXIV.—On the word “ Ducdame,” in As You Like it.\n\nThe notes of the commentators on this word, which occurs\nin a song in “ As You Like It,” are by no means satisfactory.\nMr. Collier judiciously omits the accent Ducdame, for, it being\nnecessarily a trisyllable, owing to the construction of the verse,\nif any accent were required, we ought to print Ducdamé. The\nmere fact of the word being a trisyllable shows at once the in-\nconsistency of attempting to establish a connexion with the\nold country song, commeneing,—\n\n“Dame, what makes your ducks to die?”\n\non which Whiter and Farmer have so elaborately written, and\nwhich Mr. Knight pronounces much more rational than Han-\nmer’s conjecture of due ad me, which is forced and unnecessary,\nI admit, but not quite so absurd as to suppose Jaques was\nusing some country call of a woman to her ducks. Mr. Collier\nseems correct when he says that Jaques’s declaration of its being\n“a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle” is merely a jeer\nupon the ignorance of Amiens. In other words, Amiens un-\nderstood as little about Ducdame as Mr. Knight and the com-\nmentators, and the answer of Jaques is playful, not a serious\nexposition of the word.\n\nI have recently met with a passage in an uncollated MS. of\nthe “Vision of Piers Ploughman,” in the Bodleian Library,\nwhich goes far to prove that Ducdamé is a burden of an old\nsong, an explanation which exactly agrees with its position in\nthe song of Jaques.

Malone assures us that John\nShakespeare could not write his own name, that he was a\nmarksman, and that his mark ‘nearly resembles the letter A.,\nand was probably chosen in honour of the lady he had\nmarried.’”\n\nMalone was evidently not aware that a considerable number\nof those persons who make use of marks, from an inability to\nwrite their names, adopt a signum, which “ nearly resembles\nthe letter A.;” the same being formed thus: (A). The\nadoption of this mark as a mode of signature was doubtless\nfirst suggested by the caret; or rather, such mark was\nidentical therewith, and originally used as the means of\nexpressing, independently of its vicarious signification, that\nthe power of writing the name was wanting.\n\nDuring many years, in which I attended as an assistant in\nthe office of my late father, (the Registry of the Archdeaconry\nof Nottingham) I had numberless opportunities of witnessing\nthe various modes of signature to official documents ; and my\nexperience records the fact that, although the much larger\nportion of markspeople signed with the cross (x) (+), yet\nmany, very many, used the caret.

Perhaps these observations may be deemed of\nlittle moment: they, however, seem to me to be called for by\nMr. Malone’s comment on the mark used by the father of\nShakespeare.\n\nI may take this opportunity of adding that the late\nColonel John Gilbert Cooper Gardiner, of Thurgarton Priory,\nNottinghamshire, (who for many years commanded the Militia\nof that county) was descended from Lady Barnard. Holding\na commission in the regiment under Col. G.’s command, I\nwas, in 1831, thrown much into the colonel’s society, during\nthe month’s training and exercise of the corps which took\nplace in that year. We had many conversations on the\nsubject of Shakespeare’s life, when he referred to his con-\nnection with the family of the bard in the person of his\nancestress, Lady Barnard. He also stated that he had fre-\nquently been applied to, by literary men of eminence con-\nnected with the Shakespeare inquiries, for information as to\nhis possession of any MSS., or other remains of Shakespeare ;\nbut that his reply had uniformly been, that his family papers\nwere so confusedly mixed up with the documents relating to his\nestates and other miscellaneous writings, that he had never\nbeen able to make an entire and satisfactory search. He still\nproposed, at some future period, to go thoroughly into such an\ninvestigation ; and I repeatedly urged the strong desire I\nentertained to assist him on the occasion, if he would accept\nmy very zealous services.\n\nSuch inquiry, however, I have reason to believe, was never\neffected.

Gardiner originally bore the name of Cooper, and\nwas grandson of John Gilbert Cooper, the poet, whose\nportrait, by Hogarth, together with a copy of D’Avenant’s\nPlays with his autograph inscribed, fell into my possession at\nthe sale of the colonel’s effects. As it is just possible that\nthis communication may afford some clue which others may\nbe disposed to follow up, it may be worthy of insertion among\nthe Shakespeare Papers.\n\nRosert Biassy, LL.D.\nRepton, near Burton-upon-Trent,\nJune 28th, 1844.\n\nEND OF VOL.

      "text": "Che Shakespeare SHSoctetp.\n\nTue Osszcr of the Shakespeare Society is to print and distribute to\nthe Subscribers books illustrative of Shakespeare and of the Literature\nof his time.\n\nTux Apvantages of the Society are the procuring valuable and in-\nteresting works at cost price, which, if published in the usual mode,\ncould not be purchased for three times the amount; and also the pre-\nserving and circulating rare works, which, being thus printed, are pre-\nserved from total destruction or oblivion. It will be perceived, there-\nfore, that members of this and similar societies receive back more than\nthe pecuniary value of their Subscription. The books are only procu-\nrable of the Society by Members.\n\nApmission to the Society, of any respectable person, is made by\napplication to the Agent.\n\nTue Svusscrirrion is £1 per annum, due on the First of January in\neach year in advance, on payment of which the Member is entitled to a\ncopy of every book printed by the Society for the year for which the Sub-\nscription is made. The Subscription is payable only to the London Agent,\nby cash or Post-office order, and must be made for the current year. The\nSubscribing for any or all of the previous years is optional.\n\nTar Arrairs of the Society are managed by a council, consisting of\nthe President, six Vice-Presidents, and twenty-one Members: five of the\nlatter retire every year, and the vacancies are filled up, on the recom-\nmendation of the Council, from the general body of the Subscribers, at\nthe Annual General Meeting.\n\nTax Councin meet on the second Tuesday in every month, to select\nand superintend the works printed by the Society; and the General\nMembers once a-year, on the 26th of April, to receive a report of the\nproceedings, and elect the new Councillors.\n\nTue Eprrors and the Council render their services gratuitously to the\nSociety; and every means are adopted to expend as nearly as possible the\nwhole amount of the Subscriptions in producing books; by which course\nalone so many are rendered for the Subscription.\n\nTax Devivery or THE Booxs is made by the London Agent, to whom\nalone all communications on the subject should be made. As it is the\nconstant object of the Council to prevent as much as possible useless ex-\npenditure, Members are requested to make a clear and permanent arrange-\nment with Mr. Ropp, for the delivery of the books; and it is desirable\nthat, where possible, a party in London be appointed to receive the publi-\ncations for the Country Subscribers. The Society deliver gratis to Mem-\nbers within three miles of the Agent’s residence, and it is a rule most\nstrictly adhered to, that No book shall be delivered until the Subscription\nis paid.\n\nConrRrBuTIONS to “The Shakespeare Society’s Papers” are solicited\nby the Council,—it having been deemed desirable to issue occasional\nvolumes thus formed and entitled, in order to create a medium for pre-\nserving and distributing illustrations of the literature, which is the\npeculiar object of the Society.",
