Words in italicised text in the Code of Conduct are defined terms and their definitions \nare set out in Appendix 1.  \nARTICLE 1 \nSCOPE AND APPLICATION  \n1.1 \nAll Players and Player Support Personnel are automatically bound by and required to comply with all \nof the provisions of the Code of Conduct.  Accordingly, by their participation (in the case of a Player) \nor assistance in a Player’s participation (in the case of a Player Support Personnel) in an International \nMatch, such Players or Player Support Personnel shall be deemed to have agreed: \n1.1.1 \nthat it is their personal responsibility to familiarise themselves with all of the requirements of \nthe Code of Conduct, including what conduct constitutes an offence under the Code of \nConduct;  \n1.1.2 \nto submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Match Referee, Judicial Commissioner or Appeal \nPanel convened under the Code of Conduct to hear and determine charges brought (and any \nappeals in relation thereto) pursuant to the Code of Conduct; and \n1.1.3 \nnot to bring any proceedings in any court or other forum that are inconsistent with the foregoing \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the Match Referee, Judicial Commissioner or Appeal Panel.      \n1.2 \nAll Players and Player Support Personnel shall continue to be bound by and required to comply with \nthe Code of Conduct until he/she has not participated (in the case of a Player), or assisted a Player’s \nparticipation (in the case of a Player Support Personnel) in an International Match for a period of three \n(3) months from the date of his/her last participation and the ICC shall continue to have jurisdiction \nover him/her under the Code of Conduct thereafter in respect of matters taking place prior to that point.   \n1.3 \nWithout prejudice to Articles 1.1 and 1.2, the ICC and the National Cricket Federations shall be \nresponsible for promoting Code of Conduct awareness and education amongst all Players and Player \nSupport Personnel. \n1.4 \nIt is acknowledged that certain Players and Player Support Personnel may also be subject to other \nrules of National Cricket Federations that govern discipline and/or conduct, and that the same conduct \nof such Players and/or Player Support Personnel may implicate not only the Code of Conduct but also \nsuch other rules that may apply.  For the avoidance of any doubt, Players and Player Support \nPersonnel acknowledge and agree that: (a) the Code of Conduct is not intended to limit the",

Instead, such individuals will be \nbound by, required to comply with, and shall submit themselves to the jurisdiction \nof the relevant National Cricket Federation’s own applicable rules of conduct.   \nARTICLE 2 \nCODE OF CONDUCT OFFENCES  \nThe Preamble of the ICC Standard Test Match, ODI and T20I Playing Conditions, sets out the definition of \nthe Spirit of Cricket, as follows: \n“Preamble – The Spirit of Cricket \nCricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the \nLaws (which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket. \nThe major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, umpires \nand, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. \nRespect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. \nRespect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. \nPlay hard and play fair. \nAccept the umpire’s decision. \nCreate a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. \nShow self-discipline, even when things go against you. \nCongratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. \nThank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result.",

      "text": "5 \n \nCricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together \npeople from different nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket.” \nThe conduct described in Articles 2.1 to 2.22 amounts to conduct which breaches the Spirit of Cricket and \ntherefore, if committed by a Player or Player Support Personnel, shall amount to an offence by such Player \nor Player Support Personnel under the Code of Conduct. \nCOMMENT: Where considered helpful, guidance notes have been provided in text boxes beneath the description of a \nparticular offence.  Such notes are intended only to provide guidance as to the nature and examples of certain conduct \nthat might be prohibited by a particular Article and should not be read as an exhaustive or limiting list of conduct that \nmay be prohibited by such Article. \nThe Code of Conduct offences cover a variety of different behaviours and levels of seriousness.  It is not intended to \npenalize trivial behavior.  For the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction for an offence, levels of charging \nhave been assigned for each offence, ranging from Level 1 for conduct of a minor nature, up to Level 4 for conduct of \nan extremely serious nature.  Where an offence is alleged to have been committed, the individual reporting the alleged \noffence must determine which of the assigned levels of offence is appropriate for the conduct in question.  Reports can \nonly be laid at the levels identified in respect of each particular offence below.    \nFor the purposes of the Code of Conduct, the phrase “during an International Match” should be interpreted broadly to \ncover all conduct which takes place at the ground on the day of an International Match, and not just conduct which \ntakes place on the field of play.  It will therefore include conduct which takes place off the field of play, for example in \nthe changing rooms, or during any of the intervals in the match.   \nFor the avoidance of doubt, the ICC’s jurisdiction to take action against a Player or Player Support Personnel under \nthis Code of Conduct is limited to incidents which take place (i) during, or in relation to, an International Match or (ii) \nduring, or in relation to, an ICC Event.  In circumstances where a Player or Player Support Personnel is involved in an \noff-field incident which may warrant action under this Code of Conduct and any code of conduct or disciplinary rules of \nthe Player or Player Support Personnel’s National Cricket Federation, the ICC will consult with the relevant National \nCricket Federation in order to determine what the most appropriate course of action against the Player or Player Support \nPersonnel should be.   \n2.1 \nExcessive appealing during an International Match \nNote: \nFor the purpose of Article 2.1, ‘excessive’ may include (a) repeated appealing of the same \ndecision; (b) repeated appealing of different decisions when the bowler/fielder knows the \nbatter is not out with the intention of placing the Umpire under pressure; (c) charging or \nadvancing towards the Umpire in an aggressive manner when appealing; or (d) celebrating \na dismissal without appealing to the Umpire when a decision is required.  It is not intended \nto prevent loud or enthusiastic appealing.  \n \nLevel 1 \n✓ \nLevel 2 \nNot applicable \nLevel 3 \nNot applicable \nLevel 4 \nNot applicable \n \n2.2 \nAbuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and \nfittings during an International Match. \nNote: \nArticle 2.2 includes any action(s) outside the course of normal cricket actions, such as \nhitting or kicking the wickets and any action(s) which deliberately (i.e. intentionally), \nrecklessly or negligently (in either case even if accidental) results in damage to the \nadvertising boards, boundary fences, dressing room doors, mirrors, windows and other \nfixtures and fittings.  For example, this offence may be committed, without limitation, when \na Player swings his/her bat vigorously in frustration and causes damage to an advertising \nboard. \n  \nLevel 1 \n✓ \nLevel 2 \nNot applicable",

The public announcement of the decision may \ninclude details of the offences committed under the Code of Conduct and of the sanctions imposed, \nif any.  Until such time as a public announcement is published, all parties and participants in the \nproceedings shall treat such proceedings as strictly confidential.  For the avoidance of doubt, \nnothing in this Article shall prevent any party (or any relevant National Cricket Federation) publicly \nconfirming the date of the hearing, the offence that is alleged to have been committed and/or the \nname of the Player or Player Support Personnel charged.  \nARTICLE 6 \nSTANDARD OF PROOF AND EVIDENCE \n6.1 \nUnless otherwise described herein, the standard of proof in all cases brought under the Code of \nConduct shall be whether the Match Referee or Judicial Commissioner is comfortably satisfied, bearing \nin mind the seriousness of the allegation that is made, that the alleged offence has been committed.  \nThis standard of proof in all cases shall be determined on a sliding scale from, at a minimum, a mere \nbalance of probability (for the least serious offences) up to proof beyond a reasonable doubt (for the \nmost serious offences).    \n6.2 \nThe Match Referee or Judicial Commissioner shall not be bound by judicial rules governing the \nadmissibility of evidence.

For example where a Player or Player Support Personnel has been charged with \n(but been found not guilty of) ‘showing dissent at an Umpire’s decision’ (Article 2.8) at Level \n2, the Match Referee may, instead, find the Player or Player Support Personnel guilty of \nthe same offence at Level 1 and impose an appropriate sanction; and  \n7.10.6 where a fine and/or costs award is imposed against a Player or Player Support Personnel, \nthen such fine and/or costs award must be paid: (a) by the Player or Player Support \nPersonnel (and not any other third party, including a National Cricket Federation); (b) to \nthe Player or Player Support Personnel’s National Cricket Federation (for onward \ntransmission to the ICC) within one calendar month of receipt of the decision imposing the \nfine.  However, the ICC will consider any request from any Player or Player Support \nPersonnel to make the payment of such fines and/or costs over a prolonged period of time \non the grounds of financial hardship.  Should any fine and/or costs award (or agreed part-\npayment or instalment thereof) not be paid to the relevant National Cricket Federation \nwithin such deadline or by the time of the next agreed payment date, the Player or Player \nSupport Personnel may not play, coach or otherwise participate or be involved in any \ncapacity in any International Match until such payment has been satisfied in full.  \n7.11 \nWhere a Player or Player Support Personnel has had Suspension Points imposed against him/her \nor has been suspended for a fixed period of time, he/she may not play, coach or otherwise \nparticipate or be involved in any capacity in the International Match(es) which: (a) are covered by \nthe application of his/her Suspension Points as determined in accordance with Article 7.9; or (b) \ntake place during the fixed period of his/her suspension.   \nNOTE: For the avoidance of any doubt, a Player or (where relevant) Player Support Personnel who has had \nSuspension Points imposed against him/her or has been suspended for a fixed period of time shall not, during \nthe International Matches which are covered by his/her Suspension Points or the period of suspension: \n(a) \nbe nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of, a substitute fielder; or \n(b) \nenter any part of the playing area (which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, the field of play \nand the area between the boundary and perimeter boards) at any time, including during any scheduled or \nunscheduled breaks in play. \nIn addition, Player Support Personnel so sanctioned shall not be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room \n(including the viewing areas) during any International Match  covered by his/her Suspension Points or the \nperiod of suspension.  Players so sanctioned will, however, be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room \nprovided that the players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the relevant International Match is not within \nthe player area described in (b) above (for example, no such Player shall be permitted access to an on-field \n‘dug-out’). \nFinally, any Player or Player Support Personnel so sanctioned shall not be prevented from attending any post-\nmatch ceremonies or presentations taking place anywhere on the field of play or otherwise following the \nconclusion of an International Match covered by his/her Suspension Points or the period of suspension unless",

In such circumstances, the Player or Player Support Personnel shall not be permitted \nto attend such ceremonies or presentations. \n7.12 \nOnce any Suspension Points or fixed period of suspension has expired, the Player or Player \nSupport Personnel will automatically become re-eligible to participate (in the case of a Player) or \nassist the participation (in the case of a Player Support Personnel) in International Matches \nprovided that he/she has paid, in full, all amounts forfeited under the Code of Conduct, including \nany fines, compensatory awards or award of costs that may have been imposed against him/her.    \nARTICLE 8 \nAPPEALS \nNOTE: For the avoidance of doubt, the right of appeal will be determined by reference to the level of offence \nwhich the decision of the Match Referee or Judicial Commissioner (as applicable) relates to, and not \nnecessarily the Level of offence originally reported.   \n \nBy way of example, a Judicial Commissioner may have been asked to determine a Level 4 Offence, but in \ncoming to his/her decision, he/she has exercised the right afforded to him/her in Article 7.10.5 and found the \nPlayer or Player Support Personnel concerned not guilty of the Level 4 Offence, but guilty of a Level 3 \nOffence.  In such circumstances, the right of appeal shall be determined on the basis of the Level 3 Offence \nand thus in accordance with Article 8.2.   \n \nIn circumstances where the application of this note would lead to the same level of adjudicator hearing the \nappeal as heard the first instance case, then the relevant adjudicatory body shall be the higher body.  By \nway of example, in the example listed above, an Appeal Panel would have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal \nagainst the Level 3 Offence even though technically under the Code of Conduct a Judicial Commissioner \nwould hear the appeal, as the first instance hearing was held before a Judicial Commissioner.  The terms of \nthis Article 8 should therefore be construed accordingly. \n8.1 \nAppeals from decisions in relation to a Level 1 Offence \n \n8.1.1 \nDecisions made under the Code of Conduct by a Match Referee in relation to a Level 1 \n \nOffence shall be non-appealable and shall remain the full and final decision  in relation to the \n \nmatter.   \n8.2 \nAppeals from decisions in relation to: (a) a Level 2 or Level 3 Offence; or (b) a Minimum Over \nRate Offence \n8.2.1 \nDecisions made under the Code of Conduct by a Match Referee in relation to: (a) a Level 2 \nor Level 3 Offence; or (b) a Minimum Over Rate Offence, may be challenged solely by appeal \nas set out in this Article 8.2.  Such decision shall remain in effect while under appeal unless \nany Judicial Commissioner properly convened to hear the appeal orders otherwise.   \n8.2.2 \nThe only parties who may appeal a decision of this nature shall be: (a) the Player or Player \nSupport Personnel found guilty of the offence or, where appropriate in the case of an offence \nunder either Article 2.11 (manipulation of an International Match), 2.14 (changing the condition \nof the ball), or 2.22 (failure to meet the Minimum Over Rate), the relevant Team Captain; (b) \nthe person who lodged the Report pursuant to Article 3,1; and (c) the ICC’s Chief Executive \nOfficer (or his/her designee). \n8.2.3 \nAny notice to appeal under this Article must be lodged with the ICC’s General Counsel within \n48 hours of receipt of the written decision of the Match Referee.
